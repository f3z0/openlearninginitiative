Even if you want to have a good relationship with them, this lack of understanding can make interactions tense, unpredictable and scary! The same is true for a lot of people as they encounter statistics and mathematical ways of working with data. &#xA0;Statistics can be confusing and opaque. &#xA0;Symbols, Greek letters, very large and very small numbers, and how to interpret all of this can leave to feeling cold and disengaged&#x2014;even fearful and resentful.<br>\n&#xA0;<br>\nBut in the modern information age, having a healthy relationship with statistics can make life a whole lot easier. We are constantly faced with an onslaught of data and claims about it&#x2014;from news articles, to Facebook and blog posts, casual and professional conversations, reports at our workplace, advertising, and claims from politicians and public officials. How can we process that information, make sense of it, evaluate truth claims, and put ourselves in a position to act on the information? &#xA0;One of the most important ways is by befriending statistics and consistently using statistical ways of thinking.<br>\n&#xA0;<br>\nThe purpose of this course, then is to help you develop a functional, satisfying, and useful life-long relationship with statistics. To achieve that goal, we will take a non-technical approach&#x2014;you will learn how statistics work and why they are so helpful in evaluating the world of information that is around us. You will learn about the logic of statistical thinking and the concepts (rather than the mathematical details and probability theory) that guide statistical inferences and conclusions.<br>\n&#xA0;<br>\nYou do not need to be a math whiz to take this course. If you can add, subtract, multiply, and divide (or just be able to use a calculator to do that!), you will be more than able to handle what will happen as this relationship develops.<br><br>\nBut by the end of the course you will be able to:</p>\n\n<ul><li>Identify the most important features of a data set</li>\n\t<li>Select a statistical test based on the features of the data</li>\n\t<li>Think like a statistical detective</li>\n\t<li>Understand the relationship between two different characteristics or variables</li>\n\t<li>Perform some simple statistical calculations and draw some conclusions from real data</li>\n\t<li>Hopefully, love stats!&#xA0;</li>\n</ul><p>We&#x2019;ll do all of this using entertaining examples related to real-life situations we all encounter in everyday life.</p>',

  description: '<p>Imagine that you are a bank and a main part of your daily business is to lend money. Unfortunately, lending money is a risky business - there is no 100% guarantee that you will get all your money back. If the borrower defaults, you will face losses in your portfolio. Or, in a bit less extreme scenario, if the credit quality of your counterparty deteriorates according to some rating system, the loan will become more risky. These are typical situations in which credit risk manifests itself.</p>\n\n<p>According to the Basel Accord, a global regulation framework for financial institutions, credit risk is one of the three fundamental risks a bank or any other regulated financial institution has to face when operating in the markets (the two other risks being market risk and operational risk). As the 2008 financial crisis has shown us, a correct understanding of credit risk and the ability to manage it are fundamental in today&#x2019;s world.</p>\n\n<p>This course offers you an introduction to credit risk modelling and hedging. We will approach credit risk from the point of view of banks, but most of the tools and models we will overview can be beneficial at the corporate level as well.</p>\n\n<p>At the end of the course, you will be able to understand and correctly use the basic tools of credit risk management, both from a theoretical and, most of all, a practical point of view. This will be a quite unconventional course. For each methodology, we will analyse its strengths as well as its weaknesses. We will do this in a rigorous way, but also with fun: there is no need to be boring.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks to the wonderful feedback of last year&#x2019;s students, the course has been further improved.<br>\nFollow us on Twitter @CRMooc for updates and hints about the course.</p>\n\n<p>&#xA0;</p>',

  'short-desc': 'Is your relationship with statistics dysfunctional? We can help: Get to know stats, build a healthy bond, and maybe even fall in love!',
  description: '<p>When you meet a new person, it is hard to know what to expect. &#xA0;You may not be able to read the person or understand what they mean. Even if you want to have a good relationship with them, this lack of understanding can make interactions tense, unpredictable and scary! The same is true for a lot of people as they encounter statistics and mathematical ways of working with data. &#xA0;Statistics can be confusing and opaque. &#xA0;Symbols, Greek letters, very large and very small numbers, and how to interpret all of this can leave to feeling cold and disengaged&#x2014;even fearful and resentful.<br>\n&#xA0;<br>\nBut in the modern information age, having a healthy relationship with statistics can make life a whole lot easier. We are constantly faced with an onslaught of data and claims about it&#x2014;from news articles, to Facebook and blog posts, casual and professional conversations, reports at our workplace, advertising, and claims from politicians and public officials. How can we process that information, make sense of it, evaluate truth claims, and put ourselves in a position to act on the information? &#xA0;One of the most important ways is by befriending statistics and consistently using statistical ways of thinking.<br>\n&#xA0;<br>\nThe purpose of this course, then is to help you develop a functional, satisfying, and useful life-long relationship with statistics. To achieve that goal, we will take a non-technical approach&#x2014;you will learn how statistics work and why they are so helpful in evaluating the world of information that is around us. You will learn about the logic of statistical thinking and the concepts (rather than the mathematical details and probability theory) that guide statistical inferences and conclusions.<br>\n&#xA0;<br>\nYou do not need to be a math whiz to take this course. If you can add, subtract, multiply, and divide (or just be able to use a calculator to do that!), you will be more than able to handle what will happen as this relationship develops.<br><br>\nBut by the end of the course you will be able to:</p>\n\n<ul><li>Identify the most important features of a data set</li>\n\t<li>Select a statistical test based on the features of the data</li>\n\t<li>Think like a statistical detective</li>\n\t<li>Understand the relationship between two different characteristics or variables</li>\n\t<li>Perform some simple statistical calculations and draw some conclusions from real data</li>\n\t<li>Hopefully, love stats!&#xA0;</li>\n</ul><p>We&#x2019;ll do all of this using entertaining examples related to real-life situations we all encounter in everyday life.</p>',

  description: '<p>Imagine that you are a bank and a main part of your daily business is to lend money. Unfortunately, lending money is a risky business - there is no 100% guarantee that you will get all your money back. If the borrower defaults, you will face losses in your portfolio. Or, in a bit less extreme scenario, if the credit quality of your counterparty deteriorates according to some rating system, the loan will become more risky. These are typical situations in which credit risk manifests itself.</p>\n\n<p>According to the Basel Accord, a global regulation framework for financial institutions, credit risk is one of the three fundamental risks a bank or any other regulated financial institution has to face when operating in the markets (the two other risks being market risk and operational risk). As the 2008 financial crisis has shown us, a correct understanding of credit risk and the ability to manage it are fundamental in today&#x2019;s world.</p>\n\n<p>This course offers you an introduction to credit risk modelling and hedging. We will approach credit risk from the point of view of banks, but most of the tools and models we will overview can be beneficial at the corporate level as well.</p>\n\n<p>At the end of the course, you will be able to understand and correctly use the basic tools of credit risk management, both from a theoretical and, most of all, a practical point of view. This will be a quite unconventional course. For each methodology, we will analyse its strengths as well as its weaknesses. We will do this in a rigorous way, but also with fun: there is no need to be boring.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks to the wonderful feedback of last year&#x2019;s students, the course has been further improved.<br>\nFollow us on Twitter @CRMooc for updates and hints about the course.</p>\n\n<p>&#xA0;</p>',

  'short-desc': 'Understand a city’s people, components, functions, scales and dynamics, as precondition for its sustainable design and management.',
  description: '<p>Understanding a city as a whole, its people, components, functions, scales and dynamics, is crucial for the appropriate design and management of the urban system. While the development of cities in different parts of the world is moving in diverse directions, all estimations show that cities worldwide will change and grow strongly in the coming years. Especially in the tropics over the next 3 decades, it is expected that the number of new urban residents will increase by 3 times the population of Europe today. Yet already now, there is an extreme shortage of designers and urban planners able to understand the functioning of a city as a system, and to plan a sustainable and resilient city. To answer questions like: Which methods can contribute to the sustainable performance of a city, and how can we teach this to the next generations, the ETH Future Cities Laboratory in Singapore has produced over the last 3 years many necessary research results. &#x201C;Future Cities&#x201D; aims to bring these latest results to the places where they are needed most.</p>\n\n<p>The only way to better understand the city is by going beyond the physical appearance and by focusing on different representations, properties and impact factors of the urban system. For that reason, in this course we will explore the city as the most complex human-made &#x201C;organism&#x201D; with a metabolism that can be modeled in terms of stocks and flows. We will open a holistic view on existing and new cities, with a focus on Asia. Data-driven approaches for the development of the future city will be studied, based on crowdsourcing and sensing. At first, we will give an overview of the components and dynamics of the future cities, and we will show the importance of information and information architecture for the cities of the future. The course will cover the origins, state-of-the-art and applications of information architecture and simulation. &#x201C;Future Cities&#x201D; will provide the basis to understand, shape, plan, design, build, manage and continually adapt a city. You will learn to see the consequences of citizen science and the merging of Architecture and information space. You will be up-to-date on the latest research and development on how to better understand, create and manage the future cities for a more resilient urban world.</p>',

Interestingly the same amazing technology has also led to a deeper understanding of the nature of current flow on an atomic scale and my aim is to make these lessons from nanoelectronics accessible to anyone in any branch of science or engineering. I will assume very little background beyond linear algebra and differential equations, although we will be discussing advanced concepts in non-equilibrium statistical mechanics that should be of interest even to specialists.<br>\n&#xA0;<br>\nIn the first half of this course (4 weeks) we will introduce a new perspective connecting the quantized conductance of short ballistic conductors to the familiar Ohm&apos;s law of long diffusive conductors, along with a brief description of the modern nanotransistor. In the second half (4 weeks) we will address fundamental conceptual issues related to the meaning of resistance on an atomic scale, the interconversion of electricity and heat, the second law of thermodynamics and the fuel value of information.<br>\n&#xA0;<br>\nOverall I hope to show that the lessons of nanoelectronics lead naturally to a new viewpoint, one that changes even some basic concepts we all learn in freshman physics. This unique viewpoint not only clarifies many old questions but also provides a powerful approach to new questions at the frontier of modern nanoelectronics, such as how devices can be built to control the spin of electrons.<br>\n&#xA0;<br>\nThis course was originally offered in 2012 on nanoHUB-U and the accompanying text was subsequently published by World Scientific.

{ title: 'The Divine Comedy: Dante\'s Journey to Freedom, Part 2 (Purgatorio)',
  'short-desc': 'After his harrowing descent into the depths of despair, the Pilgrim Dante emerges with Virgil onto the Isle of Mount Purgatorio in the southern hemisphere. There he will be healed of sin and prepared for his climactic reunion with Beatrice.',
  description: '<p><em>Now I shall sing the second kingdom,</em><br><em>there where the soul of man is cleansed,</em><br><em>made worthy to ascend to Heaven.</em><br><em>-Purgatorio</em>, Canto I, lines 4-6</p>\n\n<p>While Hell is &#x201C;black, confined, stinking, noisy, and suffocating, the great Mountain of Purgatory rises in pure sunlit solitude out of the windswept southern sea.&#x201D; (Sayers,<em> Purgatorio;</em> Introduction)&#xA0; Dante has undergone a conversion which has, literally, turned his world upside down.</p>\n\n<p>Sadly, the majority of Dante&#x2019;s readers do not accompany him beyond his escape from the Inferno, in part, perhaps, because of an instinctive anticipation that when the excitement of adventure is over, then the hard work of maturation must begin. Indeed, there is work aplenty on Mount Purgatorio, but there is also so much more. There is day and night, labor and rest, waking and dreaming, all the rhythms of diurnal living; but above all, there is the delight of hope. All that the penitent souls suffer here, they undergo in the eagerness of passionate yearning to be healed of the wounds of sin inflicted on them as part of the universal heritage of humanity. Purgatory is a &#x201C;school of contemplation,&#x201D; where the healing of wounds coincides with learning to suffer the weight of responsibility for one&#x2019;s own identity as a person. For those willing to undertake the steep ascent of Dante&#x2019;s seven-story Mountain, nowhere in the legacy of human culture is the process of becoming a &#x201C;whole person&#x201D; more closely observed or rendered with deeper psychological and social insight than in the cantos of Dante&#x2019;s <em>Purgatorio.</em></p>\n\n<p>For us as modern readers, Mount Purgatorio is a steep ascent indeed, and if fewer of us accept this challenging invitation than do for the careen through Hell, then it should come as no surprise for us to learn of the untold years, centuries perhaps, that the souls whom Dante meets there require to complete their climb. A realistic willingness to suffer consciously and voluntarily, motivated by authentic hope, is hardly recognized as a possibility by most of us today for whom security and prosperity are accepted as the unqualified goals of our striving. Even to consider an alternative of the sort which Dante offers us in the <em>Purgatorio </em>is already a notable achievement, but one which the imaginative power of Dante&#x2019;s poetry here places within our reach. Do not let the opportunity pass you by.</p>\n\n<p><span>In this course, you will be asked to participate in learning&#xA0;</span><span>activities on both edX and on MyDante, an innovative platform for deep&#xA0;</span><span>reading that emphasizes mindfulness and contemplative reading habits&#xA0;</span><span>as key to deriving lasting meaning from poetic texts. The pedagogical&#xA0;</span><span>approach of the course goes beyond mere academic commentary on the&#xA0;</span><span>poem as literature; it introduces the reader to a way of thinking about&#xA0;</span><span>the meaning of the poem at a personal level.&#xA0;</span><span>This module is the second of three modules that compose the full course. A module on the <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/georgetownx/georgetownx-humx421-01x-divine-comedy-1549#.VCn-SSldU54">Vita Nuova and Inferno</a> will launch on October 15, 2014, and the concluding module on <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/georgetownx/georgetownx-humx423-01x-divine-comedy-3216#.VCn_qSldU54">Paradiso</a> will launch in April 2015.

  description: '<p>Understanding a city as a whole, its people, components, functions, scales and dynamics, is crucial for the appropriate design and management of the urban system. While the development of cities in different parts of the world is moving in diverse directions, all estimations show that cities worldwide will change and grow strongly in the coming years. Especially in the tropics over the next 3 decades, it is expected that the number of new urban residents will increase by 3 times the population of Europe today. Yet already now, there is an extreme shortage of designers and urban planners able to understand the functioning of a city as a system, and to plan a sustainable and resilient city. To answer questions like: Which methods can contribute to the sustainable performance of a city, and how can we teach this to the next generations, the ETH Future Cities Laboratory in Singapore has produced over the last 3 years many necessary research results. &#x201C;Future Cities&#x201D; aims to bring these latest results to the places where they are needed most.</p>\n\n<p>The only way to better understand the city is by going beyond the physical appearance and by focusing on different representations, properties and impact factors of the urban system. For that reason, in this course we will explore the city as the most complex human-made &#x201C;organism&#x201D; with a metabolism that can be modeled in terms of stocks and flows. We will open a holistic view on existing and new cities, with a focus on Asia. Data-driven approaches for the development of the future city will be studied, based on crowdsourcing and sensing. At first, we will give an overview of the components and dynamics of the future cities, and we will show the importance of information and information architecture for the cities of the future. The course will cover the origins, state-of-the-art and applications of information architecture and simulation. &#x201C;Future Cities&#x201D; will provide the basis to understand, shape, plan, design, build, manage and continually adapt a city. You will learn to see the consequences of citizen science and the merging of Architecture and information space. You will be up-to-date on the latest research and development on how to better understand, create and manage the future cities for a more resilient urban world.</p>',

The course consists of modules on forests and livelihoods in developing countries, agroforestry, human health in forested environments, protected areas and their sustainability, small and medium forest enterprises (SMFEs), and &#xA0;community forestry. Three cross-cutting themes (gender, tenure and forest rights, and climate change) will span all of the modules.<br><br>\nThis course will engage you in developing a deeper understanding of the fundamental importance of forest resources in the lives and livelihoods of people in developing countries. Participants from tropical and developing countries may have lived much of what we will talk about in this course, and your experiences will deepen our understanding of the course material. Participants not from a developing country will gain a much better appreciation for the multitude of ways that people in developing countries use forest resources. Weekly videos will be complemented by readings, quizzes, and links to online resources to help you explore current scholarship in this domain. A discussion forum will enable you to delve more deeply into these issues with other participants and the course staff.

Indeed, there is work aplenty on Mount Purgatorio, but there is also so much more. There is day and night, labor and rest, waking and dreaming, all the rhythms of diurnal living; but above all, there is the delight of hope. All that the penitent souls suffer here, they undergo in the eagerness of passionate yearning to be healed of the wounds of sin inflicted on them as part of the universal heritage of humanity. Purgatory is a &#x201C;school of contemplation,&#x201D; where the healing of wounds coincides with learning to suffer the weight of responsibility for one&#x2019;s own identity as a person. For those willing to undertake the steep ascent of Dante&#x2019;s seven-story Mountain, nowhere in the legacy of human culture is the process of becoming a &#x201C;whole person&#x201D; more closely observed or rendered with deeper psychological and social insight than in the cantos of Dante&#x2019;s <em>Purgatorio.</em></p>\n\n<p>For us as modern readers, Mount Purgatorio is a steep ascent indeed, and if fewer of us accept this challenging invitation than do for the careen through Hell, then it should come as no surprise for us to learn of the untold years, centuries perhaps, that the souls whom Dante meets there require to complete their climb. A realistic willingness to suffer consciously and voluntarily, motivated by authentic hope, is hardly recognized as a possibility by most of us today for whom security and prosperity are accepted as the unqualified goals of our striving. Even to consider an alternative of the sort which Dante offers us in the <em>Purgatorio </em>is already a notable achievement, but one which the imaginative power of Dante&#x2019;s poetry here places within our reach. Do not let the opportunity pass you by.</p>\n\n<p><span>In this course, you will be asked to participate in learning&#xA0;</span><span>activities on both edX and on MyDante, an innovative platform for deep&#xA0;</span><span>reading that emphasizes mindfulness and contemplative reading habits&#xA0;</span><span>as key to deriving lasting meaning from poetic texts. The pedagogical&#xA0;</span><span>approach of the course goes beyond mere academic commentary on the&#xA0;</span><span>poem as literature; it introduces the reader to a way of thinking about&#xA0;</span><span>the meaning of the poem at a personal level.&#xA0;</span><span>This module is the second of three modules that compose the full course.

  description: '<p>Understanding a city as a whole, its people, components, functions, scales and dynamics, is crucial for the appropriate design and management of the urban system. While the development of cities in different parts of the world is moving in diverse directions, all estimations show that cities worldwide will change and grow strongly in the coming years. Especially in the tropics over the next 3 decades, it is expected that the number of new urban residents will increase by 3 times the population of Europe today. Yet already now, there is an extreme shortage of designers and urban planners able to understand the functioning of a city as a system, and to plan a sustainable and resilient city. To answer questions like: Which methods can contribute to the sustainable performance of a city, and how can we teach this to the next generations, the ETH Future Cities Laboratory in Singapore has produced over the last 3 years many necessary research results. &#x201C;Future Cities&#x201D; aims to bring these latest results to the places where they are needed most.</p>\n\n<p>The only way to better understand the city is by going beyond the physical appearance and by focusing on different representations, properties and impact factors of the urban system. For that reason, in this course we will explore the city as the most complex human-made &#x201C;organism&#x201D; with a metabolism that can be modeled in terms of stocks and flows. We will open a holistic view on existing and new cities, with a focus on Asia. Data-driven approaches for the development of the future city will be studied, based on crowdsourcing and sensing. At first, we will give an overview of the components and dynamics of the future cities, and we will show the importance of information and information architecture for the cities of the future. The course will cover the origins, state-of-the-art and applications of information architecture and simulation. &#x201C;Future Cities&#x201D; will provide the basis to understand, shape, plan, design, build, manage and continually adapt a city. You will learn to see the consequences of citizen science and the merging of Architecture and information space.

Make sure to check for reruns of this course.</p>\n\n<hr><p>How do we understand architecture? One way of answering this question is by looking through the lens of history. This course will examine architecture through time, beginning with First Societies and extending to the 15th century. Though the course is chronological, it is not intended as a linear narrative, but rather aims to provide a more global view, by focusing on different architectural &quot;moments.&quot; The lectures will give students the appropriate grounding for understanding a range of buildings and contexts. The material in the lectures will be supplemented by readings from the textbook <em>A Global History of Architecture</em>. Each lecture analyzes a particular architectural transformation arising from a dynamic cultural situation. How did the introduction of iron in the ninth century BCE impact regional politics and the development of architecture? How did new religious formations, such as Buddhism and Hinduism, produce new architectural understandings? What were the architectural consequences of the changing political landscape in northern Italy in the 14th century? How did rock-cut architecture move across space and time from West Asia to India to Africa? How did the emergence of corn impact the rise of religious and temple construction in Mexico? These are typical questions that the lectures will address.</p>\n\n<p>All required readings are available within the courseware, courtesy of Wiley.

  description: '<p>Imagine that you are a bank and a main part of your daily business is to lend money. Unfortunately, lending money is a risky business - there is no 100% guarantee that you will get all your money back. If the borrower defaults, you will face losses in your portfolio. Or, in a bit less extreme scenario, if the credit quality of your counterparty deteriorates according to some rating system, the loan will become more risky. These are typical situations in which credit risk manifests itself.</p>\n\n<p>According to the Basel Accord, a global regulation framework for financial institutions, credit risk is one of the three fundamental risks a bank or any other regulated financial institution has to face when operating in the markets (the two other risks being market risk and operational risk). As the 2008 financial crisis has shown us, a correct understanding of credit risk and the ability to manage it are fundamental in today&#x2019;s world.</p>\n\n<p>This course offers you an introduction to credit risk modelling and hedging. We will approach credit risk from the point of view of banks, but most of the tools and models we will overview can be beneficial at the corporate level as well.</p>\n\n<p>At the end of the course, you will be able to understand and correctly use the basic tools of credit risk management, both from a theoretical and, most of all, a practical point of view.

The course will include such topics as the electrical transmission of information, the physical propagation of radio signals, the principles and challenges of sharing a common medium, standards and patents, spectrum licenses and auctions, privacy and security issues, and societal impact of wireless communication services and applications.<br><br>\nIn addition to directed readings, video sessions, and learning exercises, students taking the course for a certificate will be required to take several quizzes and, in the last two weeks of the course, to develop a project selected from one of several options. We are excited to introduce you to the myriad aspects of the wireless revolution and to explore with you how wireless is changing today&#x2019;s society.</p>',

Certain features of this course may not be active, but many people enjoy watching the videos and working with the materials. Make sure to check for reruns of this course.</p>\n\n<hr><p>How do we understand architecture? One way of answering this question is by looking through the lens of history. This course will examine architecture through time, beginning with First Societies and extending to the 15th century. Though the course is chronological, it is not intended as a linear narrative, but rather aims to provide a more global view, by focusing on different architectural &quot;moments.&quot; The lectures will give students the appropriate grounding for understanding a range of buildings and contexts. The material in the lectures will be supplemented by readings from the textbook <em>A Global History of Architecture</em>. Each lecture analyzes a particular architectural transformation arising from a dynamic cultural situation. How did the introduction of iron in the ninth century BCE impact regional politics and the development of architecture? How did new religious formations, such as Buddhism and Hinduism, produce new architectural understandings? What were the architectural consequences of the changing political landscape in northern Italy in the 14th century? How did rock-cut architecture move across space and time from West Asia to India to Africa? How did the emergence of corn impact the rise of religious and temple construction in Mexico? These are typical questions that the lectures will address.</p>\n\n<p>All required readings are available within the courseware, courtesy of Wiley.

L&#x2019;approche poursuivie sera descriptive plut&#xF4;t que prescriptive. Contrairement aux th&#xE9;oriciens du jeu qui &#xAB;&#xA0;examinent ce que de super-hommes, ultra-intelligents et impeccablement rationnels devraient faire dans les situations comp&#xE9;titives&#xA0;&#xBB;, nous explorerons la fa&#xE7;on dont &#xAB;&#xA0;des &#xEA;tres imparfaits se comportent dans la r&#xE9;alit&#xE9;&#xA0;&#xBB; (Ra&#xEF;ffa, 1982, p. 21). Ainsi, les &#xEA;tres humains poursuivent des motivations, ont des attentes, des pr&#xE9;jug&#xE9;s, des biais et des &#xE9;motions. Ils analysent l&#x2019;information qui leur est soumise et prennent des d&#xE9;cisions &#xE0; travers le spectre de leurs propres limites cognitives. Leurs actions fluctuent en fonction de la situation ou de leur personnalit&#xE9;. Toutes ces variables influencent non seulement le comportement des personnes mais, plus fondamentalement, elles modifient la dynamique m&#xEA;me de r&#xE9;solution des divergences.

But motivations in negotiations are not limited to the pursuit of maximum profit. Negotiations concern all dimensions of human life. We negotiate every day, in all spheres of our lives: at work, with family, and with friends. We negotiate in attempts to share material goods, but also to solve divergence of interests, to reconcile different desires, dreams, tastes, and colors.<br>\n&#xA0;<br>\nThis course attempts to account for psychological phenomena at the basis of negotiation behaviors. Our approach will be descriptive rather than prescriptive. Unlike game theorists who &#x201C;look at what ultra-smart and impeccably rational super-human beings should do in competitive situations,&#x201D; we will explore how &#x201C;imperfect beings behave in reality (Ra&#xEF;ffa, 1982). Human beings pursue motivations, have expectations, show prejudice, display biases and emotions. They analyze information submitted to them and make decisions that are tainted by their cognitive limitations. Their actions fluctuate as a function of the situation they are embedded in, as well as their personality. All these variables influence not only the behavior of people, but more fundamentally, the very dynamic of negotiation instances. This course will highlight these multiple variables and offer students a detailed understanding of the psychological processes involved before, during, and after negotiation.<br>\n&#xA0;<br>\nUpon completion of this course, you will be able to:\n<ul><li>Master knowledge about the behavior of individuals when they have to manage their differences and conflicts through the technique of negotiation;</li>\n\t<li>Analyze, criticize and model situations of divergence and conflict;</li>\n\t<li>Take a critical stance vis-&#xE0;-vis your own behavior and the behavior of others in negotiation&#xA0;</li>\n</ul>\nThis course is taught in French.',

  description: '<p>With a significant increase in high-profile data breaches and cybersecurity threats in the last couple years, it is critical for businesses to learn about the costs and investment decisions around securing their online systems. If you make decisions around IT investments in your job or are interested in learning more about securing your business, this course is for you.</p>\n\n<p>While many businesses think of cybersecurity as a technical problem, this course broadens that view and shows that security failures are caused as often by bad business decisions and incentive systems as by bad technical design.</p>\n\n<p>This course provides an introduction to the field of the economics behind cybersecurity, delivered by four leading research teams from distinguished universities around the world, including:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Michel van Eeten of Delft University of Technology in The Netherlands</li>\n\t<li>Ross Anderson of Cambridge University in the United Kingdom</li>\n\t<li>Rainer Boehme&#xA0;of University of M&#xFC;nster in Germany</li>\n\t<li>Carlos H.Ga&#xF1;&#xE1;n of Delft University of Technology in The Netherlands</li>\n\t<li>Tyler Moore of Southern Methodist University in the USA</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>It will provide you with the economic concepts, measurement approaches and data analytics to make better security decisions, while helping you to understand the forces that shape the security decisions of other businesses, products and services.</p>\n\n<p>This course will:</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>Teach you to make choices on investing in your company&#x2019;s cybersecurity. We discuss and apply different economic models that help determine the costs and benefits of security investments.</li>\n\t<li>Arm you with research to make strategic business decisions. We review empirical research into security decisions and incentives of actors. We analyze data on firms in different markets, and apply economic concepts to explain the strategies of attackers.</li>\n\t<li>Review policy and regulations. We discuss available economic tools to better align the incentives for cybersecurity, including better security metrics, cyber insurance/risk transfer, information sharing, and liability assignment.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>This course offers a broad view of the field through lectures and exercises that can apply to both early career professionals as well as senior technical managers.</p>\n\n<p>After finishing this course you will be able to apply economic analysis and data analytics. You will understand the role played by incentives on the adoption and effectiveness of security mechanisms, and on the design of technical, market-based, and regulatory solutions to different security threats.<br>\n&#xA0;<br>\nAfter successfully completing this course, you will:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Position yourself as a vital subject matter expert regarding the economic drivers that influence cybersecurity and position your company to move forward and stay competitive.</li>\n\t<li>Engage confidently with management on opportunities and cybersecurity challenges faced by your industry; analyze emerging security threats and how these threats can be mitigated by effectively addressing real economic problems.</li>\n\t<li>Learn and assess the issues of investment in cybersecurity, making your company more productive, while saving time and money.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Upon successful completion of this course, learners will be awarded a DelftX Professional Education Certificate.

Knowing the principles of contracts is not just a skill needed by lawyers, it illuminates for everyone a crucial institution that we use all the time and generally take for granted.<br><br>\nThis course is designed to introduce the range of issues that arise when entering and enforcing contracts. It will provide an introduction to what a contract is and also analyze the purpose and significance of contracts. Then, it will discuss the intent to create legal relations, legality and morality, and the distinction between gifts and bargains. The course also investigates common pitfalls: one-sided promises, mistake, fraud, and frustration. With the knowledge of what makes contracts and how they can go wrong, Professor Fried will discuss remedies and specific performance. Finally, Professor Fried will introduce how contracts can create rights for third parties.&#xA0;<br><br>\nThe course&#x2019;s instructor, Charles Fried, has been teaching at Harvard Law School for more than 50 years and has written extensively on contracts.

There has been a lot written about the fact that human beings do not process information and make decisions in an optimal fashion. This course builds on much of the fascinating work in the area of behavioural economics and allows the student to develop a hands-on approach by learning its methods and more importantly, how it can be harnessed by suitably designing contexts to &#x201C;nudge&#x201D; choice. In three modules, students will be able to a) explain and interpret the principles underlying decision-making and compare the nudging approach to other methods of behaviour change, b) learn how to critique, design and interpret the results of experiments; and c) design nudges and decision-tools to help people make better decisions. Understanding experimental design and interpretation is central to your ability to truly use behavioural economics and will set you apart from people who merely know about the behavioural research. Hence, after the first two weeks of understanding the basic principles, we will devote two weeks to studying experimental design and analysis, and the final two weeks to understanding processes for designing nudges and for helping people make better decisions.</p>\n\n<p>Students will also witness and participate in weekly topical debates on various topics like &#x201C;does irrationality impact welfare?&#x201D; or &#x201C;What strategy is better for improving welfare &#x2013; nudging or education?&#x201D; If you&#x2019;ve been fascinated with the buzz surrounding behavioural economics but are not sure how to actually use it, this course is for you.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Guest Appearances:</strong> Several leading scholars, policy makers, businesspeople and authorscommentators will make short appearances in our debate and discussion sections.

Get behind the headlines &#x2014; and polarized debates &#x2014; and join others who want to think deeply and openly about these problems. Some are as old as life itself: the vulnerability of illness, the fact of death. Some are new, brought on by a dizzying pace of technology that can unsettle our core ideas about human nature and our place in the world. And nearly all intersect with issues of racial and gender equality, as well as policies affecting the world&#x2019;s most vulnerable populations.</p>\n\n<p>Designed to introduce students to the range of issues that define bioethics, together with core concepts and skills, this course should be of interest to undergraduates, health care professionals, policy makers, and anyone interested in philosophy or ethics.</p>\n\n<p>Before your course starts, try the new edX Demo where you can explore the fun, interactive learning environment and virtual labs. <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/edx/edxdemo101/edx-demo/1038">Learn more</a>.</p>',

This course will give you the skills necessary to address the environmental issues we are facing today by examining scientific principles and the application of those principles to natural systems.&#xA0; This course will survey some of the many environmental science topics at an introductory level, ultimately considering the sustainability of human activities on the planet.</p>\n\n<p>Environmental impacts on Earth come from the number of people and the amount and types of resources that they use. By applying scientific principles and considering real-world examples, we will examine:</p>\n\n<ol><li>The field of environmental science and how to think like an environmental scientist.</li>\n\t<li>The human population and the ways in which changes in the population affect the environment.</li>\n\t<li>Agriculture, soils and the environmental implications of eating meat, vegetables, local, organic, sustainable, industrial and other types of food.</li>\n\t<li>Non-renewable fossil fuels with a focus on coal, petroleum and natural gas and the benefits and consequences of using each.</li>\n\t<li>Renewable fuels such as wind and solar and identify that even renewable &#x201C;green&#x201D; energy sources have impacts as well as benefits.</li>\n\t<li>Biodiversity and global change, which are the integrating units of environmental science.</li>\n</ol><p><strong>Education method</strong><br>\nThe course will utilize video lectures, interviews with experts, readings, real-world problem sets, discussions, multiple choice and free response self-assessments and one graded exam per week.

  description: '<p>Global Health is a new field within public health sciences that integrates the knowledge from fields such as epidemiology, medicine, economy and the behavioral sciences. The main aim of the course, An Introduction to Global Health, is to describe and analyze variation in health between and within countries. This will provide an understanding of causes of the variation. The course will include measurements and determinants of health. Further, the course offers a public health perspective of the global burden of diseases. The course will specifically address: Maternal and Child Health; Sexual reproductive health and rights; Major infectious disease - malaria, TB, HIV, pneumonia; Non communicable disease; Mental health; Disasters; Injuries; Health systems and financing; and Health policy. Analysis will be done from a gender and equity perspective.</p>\n\n<p>The course combines different teaching methods: lectures, self-study, and exercises using gapminder tools (Gapminder.org) to analyze indicators. An added value is that the course is open to participants from different parts of the world, which creates an intercultural learning and teaching environment.</p>\n\n<p>By the end of this course, you should have a good idea of how these key global health challenges are approached by different stakeholders. You will have developed an understanding of what kind of solutions exist today and hopefully you will be curious as to how to make positive difference in the world.</p>',

{ title: 'Pragmatic Randomized Controlled Trials in Health Care',
  'short-desc': 'Pragmatic randomized controlled trials reliably work out which of several healthcare interventions works best under real-world conditions.',
  description: '<p>For the first hundreds of years of modern medicine, progress was a process of trial and error, and to be honest, it was often fatal error, such as bloodletting, which killed the first US president George Washington. Where diseases were clearly understood, and where treatments obviously worked on most patients, such as penicillin for pneumonia, there was no need to delve deeper into questions of effectiveness. But for most conditions, the treatment benefits were modest and there was a need for improved ways of telling whether a new intervention was better than the previous standard treatment. And so scientists introduced a testing procedure for new treatments - the randomized controlled trial.</p>\n\n<p>As the cost of developing new treatments grew, it became very important to detect the slightest improvement that could be attributed to the new drug in order to get it licensed and marketed. So the usual randomized trial was answering the following question: does this treatment work (for otherwise well people with just this single disease, with perfect adherence, treated by the best doctors, under idealised conditions)? But most patients have multiple diseases, imperfect adherence, ordinary doctors and non-ideal circumstances. These patients want to know whether a new treatment is likely to reduce important harms for ordinary people like them, receiving usual care. This mismatch meant that most trials were overestimating the real world effectiveness of new interventions.</p>\n\n<p>In this MOOC, we are going to study this mismatch, and see what its effect is on modern medical care. One example of the studies we will discuss is the VIGOR trial. This influential drug trial resulted in the widespread global overuse of this drug, at a cost of wasted billions of dollars. Ironically, this drug, intended to reduce a problem in individuals, ended up causing more of the same problem in the population!</p>\n\n<p>After we understand the consequences of designing the wrong kinds of trials, we will also look at how best to design pragmatic randomized trials, which answer the important questions that ordinary patients and decision makers in the real world most often ask. We will also explore how these can be combined with economic evaluations and qualitative research &#x2013; to answer important questions about how much these interventions cost, and how they are experienced by the recipients.</p>',

  description: '<p>The function of the brain is to govern behavior, and the aim of this course is to causally link biophysical mechanisms with simple behaviors studied in mice. The brain processes information through the concerted activity of many neurons, which communicate with each other through synapses organised in highly dynamic networks. The first goal of the course is to gain a detailed understanding of the structure and function of the fundamental building blocks of the mammalian brain, its synapses and neurons. The second goal is to understand neuronal networks, with specific emphasis on the interactions of excitatory glutamatergic and inhibitory GABAergic neurons. The third goal is to place neuronal network function in the context of sensory processing ultimately leading to behavioral decisions and motor output.</p>',

If so, then this course is for you. Last spring, we kicked off a world-wide experiment to see if Kegan and Lahey&#x2019;s ground-breaking, award-winning approach (the <em>Immunity to Change</em> process) could be deployed online to help tens of thousands of people make lasting changes at work or in their private lives. The experiment was largely a success! Many participants succeeded at making important changes in their lives. Here&#x2019;s what our students have to say:</p>\n\n<ul><li>&#x201C;When I first started, I was a bit skeptical on how I would actually change. Looking back at myself 14 weeks ago and comparing it with how I am now is incredible! I couldn&apos;t be happier that I decided to take this course and learn a new approach to change. My life is so much better because of it.&#x201D;</li>\n\t<li>&#x201C;Someone asked me recently if I felt like I&apos;d just wasted 14 whole weeks on self-inquiry. I can honestly say no - I feel like I wasted 30 years sleepwalking!&#xA0; An incredible experience. Bob and Lisa have created a truly wondrous process, and the staff and fellow students have built a rich and supportive learning environment.&#x201D;&#xA0;</li>\n\t<li>&#x201C;I appreciated the opportunity to feel like I was a part of a bigger community striving to grow and improve. This made me want to constantly push myself because I believed in the power behind the material and in the power of being part of a community working toward similar goals.&#x201D;</li>\n\t<li>&#x201C;This has been an amazing course and I have made long lasting changes that I didn&apos;t even dream about when I began this course. There is no way to express my deepest thank you for that . . . my life is changed.&#x201D;</li>\n</ul><p>This fall, we invite you to join us in a continuation of this experimental personal development course. Via demonstrations, exercises, readings, personal experiments, and novel interactive tools, this course will teach you new psychological theory about personal change, but&#x2014;more than this&#x2014;it will engage you in applying that theory to yourself from the first class to the last.</p>\n\n<p>In 2011 Oprah Winfrey listed the Top Ten Things You Should Do to Start the New Year Right.

You will also learn self-help tools based on behavioral medicine, for whatever you need to change in your life.</span>\n\n<p>We&#x2019;ll start the first week by looking at what makes us motivated to change our behavior. We often feel motivated for change when we experience imbalance in life. One example of a key concept that helps us understand how imbalance arises is the effort-reward model, which states that ill-health is more likely to arise when there is a gap between the effort you make and how you are rewarded. To help people who are experiencing imbalance identify what they need to change, we will learn about Motivational Interviewing (MI), a counseling style that stimulates behavior change.

The following four weeks will focus on coping with stress (week 2), improving sleep (week 3), increasing physical activity (week 4), and everyday behaviors (week 5) like hand washing, condom use and minimizing risky alcohol use.</p>\n\n<p>To complete this course, you will need to set aside about 5-8 hours a week. You&#x2019;ll use some of this time to watch course videos, answer questions designed to help you reinforce and retain what you have learned, and understand the homework required. The remaining time will be for course reading, mostly open access scientific articles, and solving homework tasks. You&#x2019;ll be doing part of the work together with other participants in the course community. After the five course weeks, you can expect to know a lot more about understanding unhealthy behaviors and how to change them for better health!</p>',

  description: '<p>While the advances in genomics promise to usher a new era in medical practice and create a major paradigm shift in patient care, the ethical, legal and social impact of genomic medicine will be equally significant. The information and potential use of genomic discoveries are no longer issues left for scientists and medical professionals to handle, but have become ones for the public at large. Rarely a day passes without a genomics-related story reported in the media. By the end of this course, students will be able to better understand the field of genomics; be familiar with various online databases and resources; and understand and appreciate the medical, social, ethical, and legal issues associated with the availability of personal genomic information.</p>\n\n<p>Given the diversity of the topics and the specific expertise required to cover each, this is a unique cross-disciplinary course where faculty from different disciplines including genetics, computational sciences, bioinformatics, genetic counseling, bioethics, law, and business will participate in lecturing. We have assembled a team of experts from various departments at Georgetown University and other institutions, to teach this comprehensive online genomics course.</p>\n\n<p>For a detailed description of the weekly topics, see the <a href="https://edge.edx.org/c4x/GeorgetownX/MEDX-202-01/asset/Genomics_Course_Outline_5222014.pdf">course outline</a>.</p>',

It aims to frame global health&apos;s collection of problems and actions within a particular biosocial perspective. It develops a toolkit of analytical approaches and uses them to examine historical and contemporary global health initiatives with careful attention to a critical sociology of knowledge. The teaching team, four physician-anthropologists, draws on experiences working in Asia, Africa, Eastern Europe, and the Americas, to investigate what the field of global health may include, how global health problems are defined and constructed, and how global health interventions play out in expected and unexpected ways. The course seeks to inspire and teach the following principles:</p>\n\n<p><em>A global awareness.</em> This course aims to enable students to recognize the role of distinctive traditions, governments, and histories in shaping health and wellbeing. In addition, rather than framing a faceless mass of poor populations as the subject of global health initiatives, the course uses ethnographies and case studies to situate global health problems in relation to the lives of individuals, families, and communities.</p>\n\n<p><em>A grounding in social and historical analysis.</em> The course demonstrates the value of social theory and historical analysis in understanding health and illness at individual and societal levels.</p>\n\n<p><em>An ethical engagement.</em> Throughout the course, students will be asked to critically evaluate the ethical frameworks that have underpinned historical and contemporary engagement in global health. Students will be pushed to consider the moral questions of inequality and suffering as well as to critically evaluate various ethical frameworks that motivate and structure attempts to redress these inequities</p>\n\n<p><em>A sense of inspiration and possibility.</em> While the overwhelming challenges of global health could, all too easily, engender cynicism, passivity, and helplessness, students learn that no matter how complex the field of global health and no matter how steep the challenges, it is possible to design, implement, and foster programs and policies that make enormous positive change in the lives of the world&#x2019;s poorest and suffering people.</p>\n\n<p>HarvardX pursues the science of learning.

That past can be directly observed through the study of the human fossil record, the materials preserved for archaeological study, and the DNA of living and extinct human populations. This course will provide an overview of human evolutionary history from the present--contemporary human variation in a comparative context--through our last common ancestor with the living great apes, some 5-7 million years in the past. Emphasis will be placed on major evolutionary changes in the development of humans and the methodological approaches used by paleoanthropologists and related investigators to develop that knowledge. The course will begin by asking basic questions about how evolution operates to shape biological variation and what patterns of variation look like in living humans and apes. We will then look at how the human lineage first began to differentiate from apes, the rise and fall of the Australopithecines, the origin and dispersal of the genus Homo, and eventually the radical evolutionary changes associated with the development of agricultural practices in the past 15,000 years. Throughout the course students will be exposed to the primary data, places and theories that shape our understanding of human evolution.</p>\n\n<p><em>Image: Hands at the Cuevas de las Manos upon R&#xED;o Pinturas, near the town of Perito Moreno in Santa Cruz Province, Argentina.

Each lecture analyzes a particular architectural transformation arising from a dynamic cultural situation. How did the introduction of iron in the ninth century BCE impact regional politics and the development of architecture? How did new religious formations, such as Buddhism and Hinduism, produce new architectural understandings? What were the architectural consequences of the changing political landscape in northern Italy in the 14th century? How did rock-cut architecture move across space and time from West Asia to India to Africa? How did the emergence of corn impact the rise of religious and temple construction in Mexico?

They talked about ethical guidance using a path metaphor &#x2013; a natural d&#xE0;o.</p>\n\n<p>We will look at two rival directions this natural d&#xE0;o model took in ancient China. The first direction views ethical paths as generated from human sources such as human history and past social practices. The other Confucian version views guidance as arising from a distinctly human guiding organ, something like a combination of our faculties of heart and mind. This organ issues the right/wrong or this/not-that judgements naturally. This internal map to moral choices branches, like a plant, as we mature. The alternative to human-based naturalism in China treated normative guidance as natural in a broader sense, such as the d&#xE0;o of water or one guided by what is beneficial vs harmful. Finally, we will take a brief look at a development after the classical period that resulted from the invasion of the more super-naturalist, Indo-European way of thinking about guidance &#x2013; Medieval Chinese Buddhism.</p>\n\n<p>Although Chinese concepts will be the focus of our discussion, all the content of this course is intended to be accessible to beginner students. For those who are beginners in Philosophy, we will include a brief introduction to the ideas of logic that further shape the Western metaphor of a law and help us understand its role in Western ethics, science and psychology so you can better understand the different ways these two philosophical metaphors explain where norms of behaviour come from, what they are about and why they are important.</p>',

The fifth and final module in <em>The Ancient Greek Hero in 24 Hours</em>, &#x201C;Hours 22-24: Plato and Beyond&#x201D; challenges the idea that Socrates was a hero, just as Plato&#x2019;s&#xA0;Socrates himself challenges&#xA0;that same idea. And yet, as we will see from reading Plato&#x2019;s&#xA0;Apology of&#xA0;Socrates&#xA0;and&#xA0;Phaedo, the idea of the hero is very&#xA0;much present in Plato&#x2019;s works &#x2013; just as it persists in&#xA0;works beyond Plato,&#xA0;whether or not these works adopt Plato&#x2019;s project of trying to substitute&#xA0;philosophy for&#xA0;literature (especially for poetry). Just as poetry serves as a&#xA0;primary representative for the idea of the hero,&#xA0;we will discover though our&#xA0;close readings that the philosophical prose of Plato likewise represents this&#xA0;same idea - though now the hero is no longer some superhuman human. Rather, the&#xA0;real hero now&#xA0;becomes the word of philosophical dialogue, which is brought back&#xA0;to life much as a cult hero is brought&#xA0;back to life ever time a heroic life is&#xA0;narrated or dramatized. In Plato&#x2019;s works, the narration and the&#xA0;dramatization&#xA0;show not the life of the hero but the life of the word that survives the&#xA0;speaker of the word,&#xA0;provided that the word engages in dialogue &#x2013; a&#xA0;philosophical dialogue that contemplates the eternal truths&#xA0;of the cosmos.&#xA0;<br>\n&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;<br><strong>See other courses in this series:</strong><br><a href="https://www.edx.org/course/harvardx/harvardx-hum2-1x-ancient-greek-hero-24-3131">Module 1, &#x201C;Hours 1-5: Epic and Lyric&#x201D;</a><br><a href="https://www.edx.org/course/harvardx/harvardx-hum2-2x-ancient-greek-hero-24-3431">Module 2, &#x201C;Hours 6-11: Signs of the Hero in Epic and Iconography&#x201D;</a><br><a href="https://www.edx.org/course/harvardx/harvardx-hum2-3x-ancient-greek-hero-24-3916" target="_blank">Module 3, &#x201C;Hours 12-15: Cult of Heroes&#x201D;</a><br><a href="https://www.edx.org/course/harvardx/harvardx-hum2-4x-ancient-greek-hero-24-4011" target="_blank">Module 4, &#x201C;Hours 16-21: The Hero in Tragedy&#x201D;</a></p>\n\n<p>HarvardX pursues the science of learning.

The third of five modules in <em>The Ancient Greek Hero in 24 Hours</em>, &#x201C;Hours 12-15: Cult of Heroes&#x201D; explores the vast variety of perspectives brought to bear on&#xA0;the idea of the&#xA0;ancient Greek hero in the versatile medium of prose, as exemplified by authors&#xA0;as varied&#xA0;as Herodotus, the so-called father of history, and Philostratus, an&#xA0;intellectual from a post-classical period&#xA0;who was prodigiously well-versed in classical&#xA0;and pre-classical lore about cult heroes.</p>\n\n<p>In&#xA0;Homeric poetry the idea of hero cult is implicit even though&#xA0;characters like Odysseus are not&#xA0;explicitly identified as cult heroes. The&#xA0;situation is different, however, in the poetry attributed to Hesiod,&#xA0;where the&#xA0;very idea of a cult hero is precisely outlined and illustrated, especially in&#xA0;the myth about the five&#xA0;generations of humankind. As we will see from&#xA0;the lively prose&#xA0;narratives of such learned and captivating authors as Herodotus and Philostratus, the mystique of cult heroes,&#xA0;both male&#xA0;and female, enthralled their adoring worshippers, who treasured the exotic&#xA0;stories of epiphanies and&#xA0;miracles that were linked with the places made sacred&#xA0;by the felt presence of heroes residing in the&#xA0;mother earth that concealed&#xA0;their bodies. We will even get the chance to read and analyze an&#xA0;eyewitness prose account of an actual initiation into the mysteries of a hero cult.&#xA0;This prose account&#xA0;brings home to us the seriousness of personally experiencing&#xA0;such an initiation, and it shows the&#xA0;emotional impact of making contact with&#xA0;the consciousness of superhuman forces that inhabit the&#xA0;mystical world of hero&#xA0;cult.</p>\n\n<p><strong>See other courses in this series:</strong><br>\n<a href="https://www.edx.org/course/harvardx/harvardx-hum2-1x-ancient-greek-hero-24-3131" target="_blank">Module 1, &#x201C;Hours 1-5: Epic and Lyric&#x201D;</a><br>\n<a href="https://www.edx.org/course/harvardx/harvardx-hum2-2x-ancient-greek-hero-24-3431" target="_blank">Module 2, &#x201C;Hours 6-11: Signs of the Hero in Epic and Iconography&#x201D;</a><br>\n<a href="https://www.edx.org/course/harvardx/harvardx-hum2-4x-ancient-greek-hero-24-4011" target="_blank">Module 4, &#x201C;Hours 16-21: The Hero in Tragedy&#x201D;</a><br>\n<a href="https://www.edx.org/course/harvardx/harvardx-hum2-5x-ancient-greek-hero-24-4026" target="_blank">Module 5, &#x201C;Hours 22-24: Plato and Beyond&#x201D;</a></p>\n<p>HarvardX pursues the science of learning.

The focus will be on elements of the art such as poetry&#x2019;s historical relation to courtship; techniques of sound in free verse; poetry&#x2019;s relation to music; the nature of greatness&#x2014;with only incidental attention to schools of poetry, categories and trends.</p>\n\n<p>Students are encouraged to think truly, carefully and passionately about what the poem says, along with how the poem feels in one&#x2019;s own, actual or imagined voice. As Robert Pinsky says, in the Preface to <em>Singing School</em>: &#x201C;this anthology will succeed if it encourages the reader to emulate it by replacing it . . . create your own anthology.&#x201D; In a comparable way, this course hopes to inspire a lifelong study of poetry.</p>',

The fourth of five modules in <em>The Ancient Greek Hero in 24 Hours</em>, &#x201C;Hours 16-21: The Hero in Tragedy&#x201D; finds us in the world of high classical poetry in drama,&#xA0;as brought to life&#xA0;in three tragedies of Aeschylus, two of Sophocles, and two of Euripides. We see&#xA0;here&#xA0;the Greek hero as best known to us from the perspective of world&#xA0;literature. The medium of drama makes&#xA0;heroes seem more familiar to us, since we&#xA0;think we know drama better than we know other verbal arts&#xA0;such as epic and&#xA0;lyric, but, by the time we finish analyzing the seven classical tragedies that&#xA0;we will be&#xA0;reading, we will see that the traditions of hero cult, infused into&#xA0;the verbal art of drama, cast an altogether&#xA0;new light on tragedy, defamiliarizing&#xA0;for us not only the heroes illuminated by this art but also the art itself.&#xA0;We&#xA0;will see, then, maybe for the first time ever, that the ancient Greek hero of&#xA0;tragedy was not at all like&#xA0;us &#x2013; even less like us than the hero of epic or&#xA0;lyric. The male and female heroes of drama were larger than&#xA0;life, far more so&#xA0;than we may ever have imagined, reaching levels of both nobility and debasement&#xA0;that&#xA0;challenge our sense of equilibrium in the cosmos. As our close readings of&#xA0;our seven chosen tragedies&#xA0;will show, there was a disequilibrium in myths about&#xA0;heroes in the remote past, and this disequilibrium&#xA0;could be compensated only by&#xA0;experiencing the equilibrium of rituals in the immediate present &#x2013; rituals&#xA0;culminating in the drama of heroic tragedy.<br>\n&#xA0;<br><strong>See other courses in this series:</strong><br><a href="https://www.edx.org/course/harvardx/harvardx-hum2-1x-ancient-greek-hero-24-3131">Module 1, &#x201C;Hours 1-5: Epic and Lyric&#x201D;</a><br><a href="https://www.edx.org/course/harvardx/harvardx-hum2-2x-ancient-greek-hero-24-3431">Module 2, &#x201C;Hours 6-11: Signs of the Hero in Epic and Iconography&#x201D;</a><br><a href="https://www.edx.org/course/harvardx/harvardx-hum2-3x-ancient-greek-hero-24-3916" target="_blank">Module 3, &#x201C;Hours 12-15: Cult of Heroes&#x201D;</a><br><a href="https://www.edx.org/course/harvardx/harvardx-hum2-5x-ancient-greek-hero-24-4026" target="_blank">Module 5, &#x201C;Hours 22-24: Plato and Beyond&#x201D;</a><br><br>\nHarvardX pursues the science of learning.

The course is based on the MIT &quot;Visualizing Cultures&quot; website devoted to image-driven research on Japan and China since the 19th century (<a href="http://visualizingcultures.mit.edu/">visualizingcultures.mit.edu</a>). The introductory module considers methodologies historians use to &#x201C;visualize&#x201D; the past, followed by three modules that explore the themes of Westernization, in Commodore Perry&#x2019;s 1853-54 expedition to Japan; social protest, in Tokyo&#x2019;s 1905 Hibiya Riot; and modernity, as seen in the archives of the major Japanese cosmetics company, Shiseido.</p>\n\n<p>Module 0: Introduction: New Historical Sources for a Digital Age (Professors Dower, Gordon, Miyagawa). Digitization has dramatically altered historians&apos; access to primary sources, making large databases of the visual record readily accessible. How is historical methodology changing in response to this seismic shift? How can scholars, students, and the general public make optimal use of these new digital resources?</p>\n\n<p>Module 1: Black Ships &amp; Samurai (Professor Dower). Commodore Matthew Perry&apos;s 1853-54 expedition to force Japan to open its doors to the outside world is an extraordinary moment to look at by examining and comparing the visual representations left to us by both the American and Japanese sides of this encounter. This module also addresses the rapid Westernization undertaken by Japan in the half century following the Perry mission.</p>\n\n<p>Module 2: Social Protest in Imperial Japan: The Hibiya Riot of 1905 (Professor Gordon). The dramatic daily reports from participants in the massive &quot;Hibiya Riot&quot; in 1905, the first major social protest in the age of &quot;imperial democracy&quot; in Japan, offer a vivid and fresh perspective on the contentious domestic politics of an emerging imperial power.</p>\n\n<p>Module 3: Modernity in Interwar Japan: Shiseido &amp; Consumer Culture (Professors Dower, Gordon, Weisenfeld). Exploring the vast archives of the Shiseido cosmetics company opens a fascinating window on the emergence of consumer culture, modern roles for women, and global cosmopolitanism from the &apos;teens through the 1920s and even into the era of Japanese militarism and aggression in the 1930s.

The second of five modules in <em>The Ancient Greek Hero in 24 Hours</em>, &#x201C;Hours 6-11: Signs of the Hero in Epic and Iconography&#x201D; explores the interactions of text and image in a culture where the &#x201C;text&#x201D; is not a written document but a live performance and where the &#x201C;image&#x201D; is not based on anything that is written down but exists as a free-standing medium of the visual arts, expressing the same myths that are being systematically expressed by the medium of Homeric poetry. Almost all of the images we will be studying are samples of a form of vase painting known as the &#x201C;Black Figure&#x201D; technique. We will practice how to &#x201C;read&#x201D; such a medium, analyzing what it tells us about ancient Greek heroes like Achilles, in conjunction with our &#x201C;reading&#x201D; the performance tradition of the Homeric Iliad itself.</p>\n\n<p>It is important to keep in mind, as we read these images and texts together, that the myths expressed by these media were meant to be taken very seriously. In the ancient Greek song culture, myth was not mere fiction. Just the opposite: myth was a formulation of eternal cosmic truths! So, the myths conveyed by the images of the paintings we will study are just as &#x201C;truthful,&#x201D; from the standpoint of ancient Greek song culture, as are the related myths conveyed by the Homeric Iliad. We need to read both the texts and the images of these myths as an accurate formulation of an integral system of thought the expresses most clearly and authoritatively all those things that really matter in life.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, this module foregrounds the historical fact, explored more fully in the third module (&#x201C;Hours 12-15: The Cult of Heroes&#x201D;), that the heroes who were characters in the myths of ancient Greek epic, lyric, and other verbal media were at the same time worshipped as superhuman forces by the communities where their bodies were thought to be hidden from outsiders. When we take for example the Homeric <em>Odyssey</em>, we find that the main hero of this epic, Odysseus, was a cult hero, not only an epic hero. And the agenda that center on the idea of a cult hero, like the prospect of immortalization after death, can be clearly seen in the overall plot of the <em>Odyssey</em>, especially in the memorable scene where the hero experiences his homecoming to Ithaca at the same moment when the sun rises as he wakes from a mystical overnight sleep while sailing homeward.</p>\n\n<p><strong>See other courses in this series:</strong><br>\n<a href="https://www.edx.org/course/harvardx/harvardx-hum2-1x-ancient-greek-hero-24-3131" target="_blank">Module 1, &#x201C;Hours 1-5: Epic and Lyric&#x201D;</a><br>\n<a href="https://www.edx.org/course/harvardx/harvardx-hum2-3x-ancient-greek-hero-24-3916" target="_blank">Module 3, &#x201C;Hours 12-15: Cult of Heroes&#x201D;</a><br>\n<a href="https://www.edx.org/course/harvardx/harvardx-hum2-4x-ancient-greek-hero-24-4011" target="_blank">Module 4, &#x201C;Hours 16-21: The Hero in Tragedy&#x201D;</a><br>\n<a href="https://www.edx.org/course/harvardx/harvardx-hum2-5x-ancient-greek-hero-24-4026" target="_blank">Module 5, &#x201C;Hours 22-24: Plato and Beyond&#x201D;</a></p>\n<p>HarvardX pursues the science of learning.

Over four centuries, Harvard University has amassed an astonishing array of tangible things&#x2014;books and manuscripts, art works, scientific specimens, ethnographic artifacts, and historical relics of all sorts. The university not only owns a Gutenberg bible, it also cares for Turkish sun dials, a Chinese crystal ball, a divination basket from Angola, and nineteenth-century &#x201C;spirit writing&#x201D; chalked on a child-sized slate. Tucked away in storage cabinets or hidden in closets and the backrooms of its museums and libraries are Henry David Thoreau&#x2019;s pencil, a life mask of Abraham Lincoln, and chemicals captured from a Confederate ship. The Art Museums not only care for masterpieces of Renaissance painting but for a silver-encrusted cup made from a coconut. The Natural History museums not only preserve dinosaur bones and a fish robot but an intact Mexican tortilla more than a century old.</p>\n\n<p>By learning how and why such things got here, you will discover how material objects have shaped academic disciplines and reinforced or challenged boundaries between people. While this course will not draw on all of these items, it will highlight several to give students a sense of the power of learning through tangible things.</p>\n\n<p>In the first section we will consider how a statue, a fish, and a gingham gown have contributed to Harvard&#x2019;s history, and you will learn the importance of stopping to look at the things around you.</p>\n\n<p>In the next section we will explore some of the ways people have brought things together into purposeful collections to preserve memory, promote commerce, and define culture.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, we will consider ways of rearranging objects to create new ways of thinking about nature, time, and ordinary work.</p>\n\n<p>Along the way you will discover new ways of looking at, organizing, and interpreting tangible things in your own environment.</p>\n\n<p>HarvardX pursues the science of learning.

The first of five modules on The Ancient Greek Hero, &#x201C;Epic and Lyric&#x201D; looks at ancient Greek heroes from the perspective of two different but related media of poetry and songmaking, <em>epic</em> and <em>lyric</em>. The major focus is Achilles, especially as viewed through the lens of the Homeric <em>Iliad</em> <u>and</u> through the &#x201C;rose-colored glasses&#x201D; of Sappho&#x2019;s songs. While the epic of the <em>Iliad</em> is typical of verbal art that is performed by and for men, the lyric songs of Sappho derive from traditions of singing performed mainly by women of all ages, including adolescents about to be initiated into womanhood. These &#x201C;women&#x2019;s traditions&#x201D; are best known for two kinds of singing, laments and love songs, which are interchangeable in contexts that will surprise the modern mind. Another surprise, as we will see, is that the <em>Iliad</em> too contains embedded &#x201C;quotations&#x201D; of such laments and love songs, and that our first impression of this epic as a &#x201C;men&#x2019;s tradition&#x201D; obscures the fact that Homeric poetry channels the songs of women as well as men.

{ title: 'The Ancient Greek Hero',
  'short-desc': 'A survey of ancient Greek literature focusing on classical concepts of the hero and how they can inform our understanding of the human condition.',
  description: '<h4>*Note - This is an Archived course*</h4>\n\n<p>This is a past/archived course. At this time, you can only explore this course in a self-paced fashion. Certain features of this course may not be active, but many people enjoy watching the videos and working with the materials. Make sure to check for reruns of this course.</p>\n\n<hr><p>What is it to be human, and how can ancient concepts of the heroic and anti-heroic inform our understanding of the human condition? That question is at the core of <em>The Ancient Greek Hero</em>, which introduces (or reintroduces) students to the great texts of classical Greek culture by focusing on concepts of the Hero in an engaging, highly comparative way.</p>\n\n<p>The classical Greeks&apos; concepts of Heroes and the &quot;heroic&quot; were very different from the way we understand the term today. In this course, students analyze Greek heroes and anti-heroes in their own historical contexts, in order to gain an understanding of these concepts as they were originally understood while also learning how they can inform our understanding of the human condition in general.</p>\n\n<p>In Greek tradition, a hero was a human, male or female, of the remote past, who was endowed with superhuman abilities by virtue of being descended from an immortal god. Rather than being paragons of virtue, as heroes are viewed in many modern cultures, ancient Greek heroes had all of the qualities and faults of their fellow humans, but on a much larger scale. Further, despite their mortality, heroes, like the gods, were objects of cult worship &#x2013; a dimension which is also explored in depth in the course.</p>\n\n<p>The original sources studied in this course include the Homeric <em>Iliad</em> and <em>Odyssey</em>; tragedies of Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides; songs of Sappho and Pindar; dialogues of Plato; historical texts of Herodotus; and more, including the intriguing but rarely studied dialogue &quot;On Heroes&quot; by Philostratus. All works are presented in English translation, with attention to the subtleties of the original Greek. These original sources are frequently supplemented both by ancient art and by modern comparanda, including opera and cinema (from Jacques Offenbach&apos;s opera <em>Tales of Hoffman</em> to Ridley Scott&apos;s science fiction classic <em>Blade Runner</em>).</p>\n\n<p>The true hero of the course is the logos (&quot;word&quot;) of reasoned expression, as activated by Socratic dialogue. The logos of dialogue requires both careful thought and close (or &quot;slow&quot;) reading, which is a core skill taught in this class.

Immunology has a long history, and researchers around the world faced with the &#x201C;enemies of human life&#x201D; have solved numerous immunological mysteries, and contributed to a paradigm shift in immunology. Nonetheless, it is as yet unknown how certain diseases like AIDS, influenza and allergies can be completely conquered. The latest immunological research is revealing that immunity is also strongly correlated with an increasing number of other diseases such as cancer, arteriosclerosis and diabetes. If we could fully understand the mechanism of immunity, we should be able to treat such diseases. We would like to introduce basic knowledge of immunology revealed by past research and share our insights on the latest findings with you for the future development of immunology.<br>\n&#xA0;<br>\nDuring this course you will learn the mechanisms of the immune system and deepen your understanding of forefront immunology research and development of medical applications. &#xA0;We especially encourage young people who are interested in life-science and immunology to join this course, as it will assist consideration of immunology research as a career.<br>\n&#xA0;<br>\nThe part one of the course consists of 5 lectures of about 90 minutes each.<br>\nThe first week covers introductory subjects and specific topics follow from the second week.<br>\n&#xA0;<br><u>Program :</u><br>\nWeek 1.

Contrairement aux th&#xE9;oriciens du jeu qui &#xAB;&#xA0;examinent ce que de super-hommes, ultra-intelligents et impeccablement rationnels devraient faire dans les situations comp&#xE9;titives&#xA0;&#xBB;, nous explorerons la fa&#xE7;on dont &#xAB;&#xA0;des &#xEA;tres imparfaits se comportent dans la r&#xE9;alit&#xE9;&#xA0;&#xBB; (Ra&#xEF;ffa, 1982, p. 21). Ainsi, les &#xEA;tres humains poursuivent des motivations, ont des attentes, des pr&#xE9;jug&#xE9;s, des biais et des &#xE9;motions.

But motivations in negotiations are not limited to the pursuit of maximum profit. Negotiations concern all dimensions of human life. We negotiate every day, in all spheres of our lives: at work, with family, and with friends. We negotiate in attempts to share material goods, but also to solve divergence of interests, to reconcile different desires, dreams, tastes, and colors.<br>\n&#xA0;<br>\nThis course attempts to account for psychological phenomena at the basis of negotiation behaviors. Our approach will be descriptive rather than prescriptive. Unlike game theorists who &#x201C;look at what ultra-smart and impeccably rational super-human beings should do in competitive situations,&#x201D; we will explore how &#x201C;imperfect beings behave in reality (Ra&#xEF;ffa, 1982). Human beings pursue motivations, have expectations, show prejudice, display biases and emotions. They analyze information submitted to them and make decisions that are tainted by their cognitive limitations. Their actions fluctuate as a function of the situation they are embedded in, as well as their personality. All these variables influence not only the behavior of people, but more fundamentally, the very dynamic of negotiation instances. This course will highlight these multiple variables and offer students a detailed understanding of the psychological processes involved before, during, and after negotiation.<br>\n&#xA0;<br>\nUpon completion of this course, you will be able to:\n<ul><li>Master knowledge about the behavior of individuals when they have to manage their differences and conflicts through the technique of negotiation;</li>\n\t<li>Analyze, criticize and model situations of divergence and conflict;</li>\n\t<li>Take a critical stance vis-&#xE0;-vis your own behavior and the behavior of others in negotiation&#xA0;</li>\n</ul>\nThis course is taught in French.',

In each module, you will begin by engaging with a case on your own, much like a jury views evidence, before engaging in small group discussions with your peers about the topic at hand. The course begins with historical legal cases and then moves to major contemporary issues. These include: decriminalization of marijuana in Jamaica and worldwide efforts to legalize, the potential for the Olympics and World Cup to advance education, individual identity and anonymity surrounding the NSA leak by Edward Snowden, and lethal police action against young black men, crystallized in the hashtag #icantbreathe.</p>\n<p>Deliberations will be real and virtual, synchronous and asynchronous. &#x2028;Cases will be hosted on the edX platform, but deliberation groups will meet in a variety of media best suited to each group. The supported deliberation environment for online synchronous deliberation will be &#x2018;Unhangout,&#x2019; a video-based discussion tool developed at the MIT Media Lab.

But, choosing a single issue area is a deliberate choice. If this course were structured more broadly, with a host of different issues, the effectiveness of each student&#x2019;s contribution would be limited. Instead Journalism for Social Change intends to leave each student with the&#xA0;<strong>experience</strong>&#xA0;of being a player in promulgating policy reform around the issues facing vulnerable children. Further, the umbrella of children allows us to explore the broad, but deeply interwoven policy areas concerning: communities, poverty, child protection, child maltreatment prevention, foster care, and the courts.<br>\n&#xA0;<br>\nIn as much, student work will be published throughout the semester and have a direct, immediate impact. Through precise, rigorous reporting and policy analysis students will substantively contribute to public discourse on this issue, and by virtue of that contribution drive political will toward positive policy solutions to the myriad social issues vulnerable children face.<br>\n&#xA0;<br>\nWith that experience, students will be better prepared to use journalism and media for social change in whatever field they explore beyond the class.',

  description: '<p>M&#xFA;ltiples y diversas manifestaciones muestran que se est&#xE1;n produciendo unos profundos cambios en el mundo. El modelo de la sociedad industrial est&#xE1; dejando paso a un nuevo modelo de sociedad, a&#xFA;n difuso, en el que la capacidad de transformar la informaci&#xF3;n en conocimiento es clave. Es f&#xE1;cil deducir que para esta nueva sociedad emergente se necesita un concepto de educaci&#xF3;n bien distinto al que requer&#xED;a la sociedad industrial. Sin este cambio educativo dif&#xED;cilmente se podr&#xE1; conseguir satisfactoriamente el cambio y, consecuentemente, instalarse adecuadamente en un mundo que va a alterarse radicalmente.</p>\n\n<p>El curso tiene dos objetivos.

Sin esta buena base es dif&#xED;cil fundamentar el siguiente objetivo del curso: el papel de la educaci&#xF3;n.</p>\n\n<p>El objetivo de tratar la educaci&#xF3;n en este curso es para presentarla en estrecha relaci&#xF3;n con una intensa crisis cultural que inevitablemente tiene que sobrevenir para que no aumente el desajuste entre el mundo tecnol&#xF3;gico -planetario, desigual y contradictorio- que hemos levantado y los valores culturales de otros tiempos con los que queremos mirar e interpretar el mundo de hoy y el que se avecina. As&#xED; que se tratar&#xE1; la estrecha relaci&#xF3;n que hay y debe haber entre educaci&#xF3;n y cultura. De igual modo se ver&#xE1; en el curso la relaci&#xF3;n entre tecnolog&#xED;a y educaci&#xF3;n, no desde el punto de vista instrumental, sino cultural.</p>\n\n<p>La pretensi&#xF3;n del curso es que de esta observaci&#xF3;n del fen&#xF3;meno actual de&#xA0; cambio, y de la interpretaci&#xF3;n del papel de la educaci&#xF3;n para la orientaci&#xF3;n y control de ese cambio, surjan elementos inspiradores de acciones educativas precisas ajustadas a las m&#xFA;ltiples realidades concretas desde las que se est&#xE1;n sintiendo los desaf&#xED;os de vivir en el siglo XXI.</p>\n\n<p>El planteamiento did&#xE1;ctico del curso seguir&#xE1; la estructura de un viaje por el tiempo, por lugares y tambi&#xE9;n por conceptos que haga ameno el recorrido durante las siete semanas.

Students are welcome to audit the course, and participate in all course activities. Certificates will not be issued.</em></p>\n\n<p>Everyone experiences adversity and stress at some level, whether it&#x2019;s the pressure to perform in school or work, relationship problems, financial difficulties, or simply the number of tasks to do in a short period of time. All stress isn&#x2019;t bad, but chronic stress can take its toll on our minds, bodies, and behavior. Research has shown that people can learn and use specific resilience skills (such as optimistic thinking, relaxation strategies, choosing one&#x2019;s attention) and positive routines (good sleep, scheduling in fun, and so on) in order to better manage stress, bounce back quicker after a setback, be more effective in their academic and vocational pursuits, develop stronger relationships with others, be physically and mentally healthy, and be satisfied with their lives overall. In short, resilience is ordinary magic and can be learned. It does not necessarily mean that you have to be born resilient or get lucky in life.</p>\n\n<p>The purpose of this course is to teach individuals the science behind becoming a resilient person. Stated simply, resilience is the ability to survive and thrive. Resiliency is not only about your ability to positively adapt in the face of adverse or challenging circumstances (that is, survive), but it is also about learning the positive skills, strategies and routines that enable you to live a happy, fulfilling, and meaningful life (in other words, thrive). This course gives you the permission to take care of yourself in order to effectively manage life stressors and do what matters most in life. This captures the notion of being from the inside out, which is a phrase that highlights the importance of promoting core resilience skills, strategies, and routines among early childhood educators. In turn, resilient people are more capable of creating and maintaining nurturing, supportive, and effective learning environments while also optimizing their own wellbeing and love for both the big and small things in life.</p>\n\n<p>By the end of this course, you will have learned about the knowledge and skills that you can apply in your life now and in the future to be a resilient person.</p>\n\n<p><u>Course goal:</u></p>\n\n<p>The goal for this course is to give you permission to take care of yourself and empower you to be a resilient person. A resilient person is someone who:</p>\n\n<ul><li>purposely strives to be as mentally and psychically healthy as possible,</li>\n\t<li>possesses the confidence to effectively cope with and manage stressful situations,</li>\n\t<li>is compassionate towards self and others,</li>\n\t<li>demonstrates grit or perseverance even in the face of adversity, and</li>\n\t<li>focuses on the positive and fulfilling aspects of life.</li>\n</ul><p><u>Course supporting objectives: </u>When you complete this course, you will be able to:</p>\n\n<ul><li>Describe why &#x2018;functioning from the inside out&#x2019; is critical to becoming a resilient, effective person\n\t<ul><li>Explain the benefits of resilience and how the specific skills translate into optimizing social-emotional wellbeing and doing what matters most in life</li>\n\t</ul></li>\n\t<li>Directly practice a variety of resilience skills in different aspects of your life, including but not limited to:\n\t<ul><li>Mindfulness practices</li>\n\t\t<li>Strategies to manage intense emotions</li>\n\t\t<li>Activities that induce positive emotions</li>\n\t\t<li>Clarifying important personal values (that is, what matters most) and committing to behaving consistent with them</li>\n\t\t<li>Making health lifestyle choices that are cheap and readily available, yet promote well-being</li>\n\t</ul></li>\n\t<li>Describe why &#x2018;practicing&#x2019; and integrating resilience skills into one&#x2019;s life is critical to making them a habit and becoming a resilient person</li>\n\t<li>Develop a resilience plan that serves as a roadmap for your future</li>\n</ul>',

We&#x2019;ll begin by introducing a specific framework for thinking about learning. We&#x2019;ll then take a close look at how educational software developers are more deeply engaging learners and even providing feedback to students as they learn.</p>\n\n<p>Week 3 will focus on forms of Active Learning, where students choose and pursue activities based on their own interests. We&#x2019;ll also talk with experts about designing to help build important non-cognitive skills, like persistence and developing mastery.</p>\n\n<p>Week 4 will move from individual learning to collaborative learning in a range of forms, from apprenticeships to communities of practice. We&#x2019;ll speak with experts about the many ways learning in groups can manifest itself. No matter what the medium, collaborative learning has a lot to teach us.</p>\n\n<p>Week 5 focuses on assessment. &#xA0;All the clever educational technology design in the world isn&#x2019;t very useful if we don&#x2019;t know whether students&#x2019; learning is being enhanced by it or what changes need to be made to increase its effectiveness.&#xA0;We&#x2019;ll talk with teachers, students, and assessment experts who will provide an overview of the different types of assessment and how technology is changing the field of assessment.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, in week 6, we&#x2019;ll talk about design-based research, a methodology for research and design of educational innovations in which you create projects that embody the educational change you wish to study.</p>\n\n<p>Week 0 of this course is a &apos;ramp-up&apos; week for participants to introduce themselves to one another and become familiar with the forums and other course platform features.</p>\n\n<p>This course is part of the EdTechX series from the MIT Education Arcade.

  description: '<p>Imagine that you are a bank and a main part of your daily business is to lend money. Unfortunately, lending money is a risky business - there is no 100% guarantee that you will get all your money back. If the borrower defaults, you will face losses in your portfolio. Or, in a bit less extreme scenario, if the credit quality of your counterparty deteriorates according to some rating system, the loan will become more risky. These are typical situations in which credit risk manifests itself.</p>\n\n<p>According to the Basel Accord, a global regulation framework for financial institutions, credit risk is one of the three fundamental risks a bank or any other regulated financial institution has to face when operating in the markets (the two other risks being market risk and operational risk). As the 2008 financial crisis has shown us, a correct understanding of credit risk and the ability to manage it are fundamental in today&#x2019;s world.</p>\n\n<p>This course offers you an introduction to credit risk modelling and hedging. We will approach credit risk from the point of view of banks, but most of the tools and models we will overview can be beneficial at the corporate level as well.</p>\n\n<p>At the end of the course, you will be able to understand and correctly use the basic tools of credit risk management, both from a theoretical and, most of all, a practical point of view. This will be a quite unconventional course. For each methodology, we will analyse its strengths as well as its weaknesses.

This is a real Caltech class. It will be taught concurrently to Caltech and on-line students. This has two implications. On the costs side: the class is challenging, makes extensive use of calculus, and will demand significant effort. On the benefit side: successful completion of the class will provide you with an in-depth understanding of basic economics, and will permanently change the way you see the world.</p>',

There has been a lot written about the fact that human beings do not process information and make decisions in an optimal fashion. This course builds on much of the fascinating work in the area of behavioural economics and allows the student to develop a hands-on approach by learning its methods and more importantly, how it can be harnessed by suitably designing contexts to &#x201C;nudge&#x201D; choice. In three modules, students will be able to a) explain and interpret the principles underlying decision-making and compare the nudging approach to other methods of behaviour change, b) learn how to critique, design and interpret the results of experiments; and c) design nudges and decision-tools to help people make better decisions. Understanding experimental design and interpretation is central to your ability to truly use behavioural economics and will set you apart from people who merely know about the behavioural research. Hence, after the first two weeks of understanding the basic principles, we will devote two weeks to studying experimental design and analysis, and the final two weeks to understanding processes for designing nudges and for helping people make better decisions.</p>\n\n<p>Students will also witness and participate in weekly topical debates on various topics like &#x201C;does irrationality impact welfare?&#x201D; or &#x201C;What strategy is better for improving welfare &#x2013; nudging or education?&#x201D; If you&#x2019;ve been fascinated with the buzz surrounding behavioural economics but are not sure how to actually use it, this course is for you.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Guest Appearances:</strong> Several leading scholars, policy makers, businesspeople and authorscommentators will make short appearances in our debate and discussion sections.

This course will examine architecture through time, beginning with First Societies and extending to the 15th century. Though the course is chronological, it is not intended as a linear narrative, but rather aims to provide a more global view, by focusing on different architectural &quot;moments.&quot; The lectures will give students the appropriate grounding for understanding a range of buildings and contexts. The material in the lectures will be supplemented by readings from the textbook <em>A Global History of Architecture</em>. Each lecture analyzes a particular architectural transformation arising from a dynamic cultural situation. How did the introduction of iron in the ninth century BCE impact regional politics and the development of architecture? How did new religious formations, such as Buddhism and Hinduism, produce new architectural understandings? What were the architectural consequences of the changing political landscape in northern Italy in the 14th century? How did rock-cut architecture move across space and time from West Asia to India to Africa? How did the emergence of corn impact the rise of religious and temple construction in Mexico?

In our FPP courses you will learn the building blocks of how to answer to these questions.</p>\n\n<p>Financial programming is a framework to analyze the current state of the economy, forecast where the economy is headed, and identify economic policies that can change the course of the economy.</p>\n\n<p>In Part 1 of the FPP sequence, presented by IMF&apos;s Institute for Capacity Development, you will learn the basic skills required to conduct financial programming. The course presents the principal features of the four main sectors that comprise the macroeconomy (real, fiscal, external, and monetary); demonstrates how to read, interpret, and analyze the accounts for these sectors; and illustrates how these sectors are interlinked. (Part 2 of the FPP sequence will cover preparation of a baseline forecast and design of an adjustment program.)</p>\n\n<p>During the course, economists from the IMF will lead you through the accounts and analysis of an economy. Besides engaging with lecture videos, you will answer questions on the concepts explained, solve short numerical exercises, discuss with fellow participants economic developments in your country, and work with data for a hypothetical country. The reading material will be provided to you.</p>\n\n<p>Whether you are a civil servant working on economic issues for your country, a professional working with economic data, or you are simply interested in better understanding the developments of an economy, this course will provide hands-on training on macroeconomic analysis. We hope that you will join us in this exciting journey!</p>\n\n<p>Financial Programming and Policies, Part 1 is offered by the IMF with financial support from the Government of Belgium.</p>',

Pre-tax subsidies, which arise when energy consumers pay less than the supply cost of energy, are high in many emerging and developing economies, and have risen in recent years. Although pre-tax subsidies are not a large enough problem in advanced economies to cause fiscal difficulties, these countries have tax subsidies, where the taxes imposed on energy are not high enough to account for all of the adverse effects of excessive energy consumption, including on the environment. The issue of energy subsidy reform is not new. Despite widespread recognition of their adverse consequences, energy subsidies have proven difficult to reform.</p>\n\n<p>This course builds on an extensive cross-country analysis, which is reported in the recently published IMF book on &#x201C;<em>Energy Subsidy Reform: Lessons and Implications</em>,&#x201D; to make recommendations on how to best implement reforms aimed at reducing state subsidies on energy.</p>\n\n<p>In the first part of the course, economists from the IMF will introduce the definition and measurement of subsidies, and then describe the economic, social, and environmental implications of subsidies. The second part of the course has two principal purposes: first, to review what works best in energy subsidy reform, in light of country experiences globally; and second, to illustrate successes and failures in particular country contexts by summarizing some case studies.</p>\n\n<p>Whether you are a civil servant working on economic issues for your country or simply interested in better understanding issues related to energy subsidies, this course will provide hands-on training on the design of successful reforms of energy subsidies.</p>\n\n<p><span>You are welcome to join us in this exciting three-week course!</span></p>\n\n<p>Energy Subsidy Reform is offered by the IMF with financial support from the Government of Belgium.</p>',

We will read current research on the developmental trajectory of children with early-onset aggressive behaviors; positive behavior support program models; and intervention efforts that promote positive early childhood mental health. Evidence-based classroom management skills will also be studied and you will leave the course with a solid understanding of how to design supportive environments. This course incorporates a community with which you can learn from others, share your own current approaches and discuss your attempts to incorporate the learnings of this course into your early childhood practice.</p>',

Through interviews with multiple experts in the field, this course examines educational technologies, outlines the theories that influenced their development, and examines their use. The course leads up to a final project &#x2013; a kickstarter style pitch for a new educational technology - which is worked on iteratively across the weeks.&#xA0; It involves active weekly participation.</p>\n\n<p>In week 1, we&#x2019;ll talk about the history of educational technologies and how they change the way we learn.&#xA0;We&#x2019;ll also discuss two important educational theories that focus on student-centered learning.</p>\n\n<p>In week 2, we&#x2019;ll explore what it means to learn something and examine several different approaches to deepen learning. We&#x2019;ll begin by introducing a specific framework for thinking about learning. We&#x2019;ll then take a close look at how educational software developers are more deeply engaging learners and even providing feedback to students as they learn.</p>\n\n<p>Week 3 will focus on forms of Active Learning, where students choose and pursue activities based on their own interests. We&#x2019;ll also talk with experts about designing to help build important non-cognitive skills, like persistence and developing mastery.</p>\n\n<p>Week 4 will move from individual learning to collaborative learning in a range of forms, from apprenticeships to communities of practice. We&#x2019;ll speak with experts about the many ways learning in groups can manifest itself. No matter what the medium, collaborative learning has a lot to teach us.</p>\n\n<p>Week 5 focuses on assessment. &#xA0;All the clever educational technology design in the world isn&#x2019;t very useful if we don&#x2019;t know whether students&#x2019; learning is being enhanced by it or what changes need to be made to increase its effectiveness.&#xA0;We&#x2019;ll talk with teachers, students, and assessment experts who will provide an overview of the different types of assessment and how technology is changing the field of assessment.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, in week 6, we&#x2019;ll talk about design-based research, a methodology for research and design of educational innovations in which you create projects that embody the educational change you wish to study.</p>\n\n<p>Week 0 of this course is a &apos;ramp-up&apos; week for participants to introduce themselves to one another and become familiar with the forums and other course platform features.</p>\n\n<p>This course is part of the EdTechX series from the MIT Education Arcade.

This initial mini-course seeks to answer the following question: How did a school system, once the envy of the world, stumble so that the performance in math, science, and reading of U.S. students at age 15 fell below that of students in a majority of the world&#x2019;s industrialized nations?</p>\n\n<p>Exploring that question, we identify the personalities and historical forces&#x2014;the progressives, racial desegregation, legalization and collective bargaining&#x2014;that shaped and re-shaped U.S. school politics and policy.&#xA0;We visit the places where new ideas and practices were spawned, and we look at some of their unanticipated consequences.&#xA0;</p>\n\n<p>In the three subsequent mini-courses, we seek answers to a second question: What are the best ways of lifting the performance of American schools to a higher level? To explore these questions, we look at ideas and proposals of those who want to save our schools&#x2014;be it by reforming the teaching profession, holding schools accountable, or giving families more school choices.&#xA0; In interviews with reform proponents and independent experts, we capture the intensity of the current debate.&#xA0;In the end, we do not find any silver bullets that can magically lift schools to a new level of performance, but we do pinpoint the pluses and minuses of many new approaches.&#xA0; These three subsequent mini-courses will launch later in the fall and continue into 2015.</p>\n\n<p>Each mini-course contains five to eight lectures, with each lecture containing approximately three videos.

How is light used in devices? How is data stored and managed? How is pollution mitigated? How are electrical signals processed? How are strong and tough materials designed and built? How is thermal energy managed? How is data transmitted? How are systems integrated? How do you make sure goods and services reach their destination? How do you start a company?

  description: '<p>The modern smartphone is enabled by a billion-plus nanotransistors, each having an active region that is barely a few hundred atoms long. Interestingly the same amazing technology has also led to a deeper understanding of the nature of current flow on an atomic scale and my aim is to make these lessons from nanoelectronics accessible to anyone in any branch of science or engineering. I will assume very little background beyond linear algebra and differential equations, although we will be discussing advanced concepts in non-equilibrium statistical mechanics that should be of interest even to specialists.<br>\n&#xA0;<br>\nIn the first half of this course (4 weeks) we will introduce a new perspective connecting the quantized conductance of short ballistic conductors to the familiar Ohm&apos;s law of long diffusive conductors, along with a brief description of the modern nanotransistor. In the second half (4 weeks) we will address fundamental conceptual issues related to the meaning of resistance on an atomic scale, the interconversion of electricity and heat, the second law of thermodynamics and the fuel value of information.<br>\n&#xA0;<br>\nOverall I hope to show that the lessons of nanoelectronics lead naturally to a new viewpoint, one that changes even some basic concepts we all learn in freshman physics. This unique viewpoint not only clarifies many old questions but also provides a powerful approach to new questions at the frontier of modern nanoelectronics, such as how devices can be built to control the spin of electrons.<br>\n&#xA0;<br>\nThis course was originally offered in 2012 on nanoHUB-U and the accompanying text was subsequently published by World Scientific. I am preparing a second edition for publication in 2015, which will be used for this course.

Potential applications range from aerial filming over remote visual inspection to automatic 3D reconstruction of buildings. Navigating a quadrotor manually requires a skilled pilot and constant concentration. Therefore, there is a strong scientific interest to develop solutions that enable quadrotors to fly autonomously and without constant human supervision.

You will learn how to infer the position of the quadrotor from its sensor readings, how to navigate along a series of waypoints, and how to plan collision free trajectories. The course consists of a series of weekly lecture videos that we be interleaved by interactive quizzes and hands-on programming tasks.

Certain features of this course may not be active, but many people enjoy watching the videos and working with the materials. Make sure to check for reruns of this course.&#xA0;</p>\n\n<hr><p>This course provides a mathematical introduction to the mechanics and control of robots that can be modeled as kinematic chains. Topics covered include the concept of a robot&#x2019;s configuration space and degrees of freedom, static grasp analysis, the description of rigid body motions, kinematics of open and closed chains, and the basics of robot control. The emphasis is not on the latest research trends and technological innovations in robotics, but on learning the fundamental concepts and core principles that underlie robotics as a scientific discipline. The intent is to help students acquire a unified set of analytical tools for the modeling and control of robots, together with a reliable physical intuition that recognizes the unique and interdisciplinary nature of robotics&#x2014;in short, content that will serve as a reliable foundation for whatever trends may appear later, and remain relevant to both the practitioner and researcher. This course is the first of two parts of &#x201C;Robot Mechanics and Control.&#x201D; Part II will start shortly after completion of Part I.</p>',

Potential applications range from aerial filming over remote visual inspection to automatic 3D reconstruction of buildings. Navigating a quadrotor manually requires a skilled pilot and constant concentration. Therefore, there is a strong scientific interest to develop solutions that enable quadrotors to fly autonomously and without constant human supervision. This is a challenging research problem because the payload of a quadrotor is uttermost constrained and so both the quality of the onboard sensors and the available computing power is strongly limited.</p>\n\n<p>In this course, we will introduce the basic concepts for autonomous navigation for quadrotors including topics such as probabilistic state estimation, linear control, and path planning. You will learn how to infer the position of the quadrotor from its sensor readings, how to navigate along a series of waypoints, and how to plan collision free trajectories. The course consists of a series of weekly lecture videos that we be interleaved by interactive quizzes and hands-on programming tasks. The programming exercises will require you to write small code snippets in Python to make a quadrotor fly in simulation.</p>\n\n<p>This course is intended for graduate students in computer science, electrical engineering or mechanical engineering.

  description: '<p><strong>The Beauty and Joy of Computing</strong> (BJC) is a computer science principles course developed at the University of California, Berkeley, intended to broaden participation in computing to non-traditional groups. Computing has profoundly changed the world, opening up wonderful new ways for people to connect, design, research, play, create, and express themselves. However, just <em>using</em> a computer is only a small part of the picture. The real transformative and empowering experience comes when one learns how to <em>program</em> the computer, to translate ideas into code. This course teaches students how to do exactly that, using Snap<em>!</em> (based on Scratch), one of the friendliest programming languages ever invented. It&apos;s purely graphical, which means programming involves simply dragging blocks around, and building bigger blocks out of smaller blocks. But this course is far more than just learning to program. We focus on seven big ideas (creativity, abstraction, data and information, algorithms, programming, the Internet, and global impact), and six computational thinking practices (connecting computing, creating computational artifacts, abstracting, analyzing problems and artifacts, communicating, and collaborating). Throughout the course, relevance is emphasized: relevance to the student and to society.

  description: '<p>This programming course is unique in focusing on learning a design method rather than a programming language.&#xA0; This practical method builds on years of research into the structure of good programs that will help you channel your creativity to program well in any language.</p>\n\n<p>A primary challenge in programming is deciding exactly what our program should do. The first contribution of the design method is a set of techniques that help you systematically develop your program requirements. You will also learn to produce programs with consistent structure that are easy to modify later. This is important because useful programs always require later improvements. In addition, you will learn how to make your programs more reliable by building tests as an integral part of the programming process.</p>\n\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Syllabus</strong></p>\n\n<p>This is a full university course broken into three parts:</p>\n\n<p>In Part 1 you will learn the core design method with a focus on simple data. In this part of the course, we introduce the idea of structuring a program based on the data it consumes. This part concludes with the design of simple interactive programs. The final project is an interactive game.</p>\n\n<p>In Part 2, the focus is on more elaborate forms of data that can be used for more complex information. You will learn when and how to structure data using lists and trees. The final project will be a more elaborate interactive game in which more complex data structures are required.</p>\n\n<p>In Part 3 you will learn about search, generative recursion, graphs and how to blend different kinds of structuring patterns together in more complex programs.&#xA0; This part of the course concludes with a complex puzzle solving program project.</p>\n\n<p>The course uses a small teaching language that includes the core features of nearly all other languages like Python, Javascript, Ruby, Java etc. Less than a week is required to learn nearly the whole language&#x2014;the entire rest of the course is spent on program design. The focus on design together with the core nature of the language means that everything you learn will be applicable in any other language you use in the future.</p>\n\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n\n<p>See also:</p>\n\n<p><a href="https://www.edx.org/course/systematic-program-design-part-1-core-ubcx-spd1x">Systematic Program Design - Part 1: The Core Method</a></p>\n\n<p><a href="https://www.edx.org/course/systematic-program-design-part-2-ubcx-spd2x">Systematic Program Design - Part 2: Arbitrary Sized Data</a></p>',

Computing is also, for most people, magic; this course will enable you to see what lies beyond the apparent magic, and to discover the science behind computing.&#xA0;</p>\n\n<p>Information Technology is everywhere. Every aspect of human activity depends on it. All IT processes, whether they drive mobile phones, the Internet, transportation systems, enterprise systems, publishing, social networks or any other application, rely on software. In this course we lift the hood and explain how to write this software. If you do not just want to be a consumer of IT services but understand how they work, and contribute to them yourself, this course is for you.</p>\n\n<p>The core skill is programming; not just the ability to piece together a few &#x201C;lines of code&#x201D;, but writing <em>quality </em>programs, which will do their job right, and meet the evolving needs of their users. Anyone can write a program; this course teaches to write <em>good </em>programs.</p>\n\n<p>The course starts from the basics of computing and takes you through a tour of modern object-oriented programming, including classes, objects, control structures, inheritance, polymorphism, and genericity.</p>\n\n<p><span>Throughout the course, you will have the opportunity to learn the principles of programming as well as the techniques for designing correct and reliable programs by using the Eiffel programming language and notation. You will be trying out example problems, provide your solution, and see it immediately compiled and tested from within your browser. To this end, we are using the </span><span><a href="https://codeboard.io" target="_self">Codeboard</a>&#xA0;web-based IDE, developed at the Chair of Software Engineering (ETH Zurich).&#xA0;</span></p>\n\n<p>Beyond programming, you will also get a glimpse at theoretical computer science, the set of mathematical techniques that underlie computation and makes today&#x2019;s IT-based world possible. You should expect to devote five hours weekly to the course. Remember that you can only learn programming in depth by writing programs, so the more you practice the better.</p>\n\n<p>The textbook for the course is: <a href="http://link.springer.com/book/10.1007%2F978-3-540-92145-5" rel="noFollow" target="_blank">Introduction to Programming Well Using Objects and Contracts, by Bertrand Meyer</a> (Springer, revised printing, 2013).</p>\n\n<p>In this second edition of the course we specifically focus on helping students with little or no programming experience. To this end, we have improved the introductory material about the Eiffel language, and we have implemented a progressive hint system students can use to get guidance on how to solve the programming exercises.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Previous edition course evaluation:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Overall course rating (1: worst grade, 6: best grade):</p>\n\n<p>Grade Resp. &#xA0; %Resp<br>\n1&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; 0&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; 0%<br>\n2&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; 1&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; 1%<br>\n3&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; 8&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; 11%<br>\n4&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; 20&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; 27%<br>\n5&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; 31&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; 42%<br>\n6&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; 13&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; 18%</p>\n\n<p>Total respondents: 73<br>\nAverage: 4.64</p>',

  description: '<p>6.341x is designed to provide both an in-depth and an intuitive understanding of the theory behind modern discrete-time signal processing systems and applications. &#xA0;The course begins with a review and extension of the basics of signal processing including a discussion of group delay and minimum-phase systems, and the use of discrete-time (DT) systems for processing of continuous-time (CT)&#xA0;signals.&#xA0; The course develops flow-graph and block diagram structures including lattice filters&#xA0;for implementing&#xA0;DT systems, and techniques for the design of DT filters. Parametric signal modeling and the efficient implementation of DT multirate and sampling rate conversion systems are discussed and developed. An in-depth development of the DFT and its computation as well as its use for spectral analysis and for filtering is presented. This component of the course includes a careful and insightful development of the relationship between the time-dependent Fourier transform and the use of filter banks for both spectral analysis and signal coding.</p>\n\n<p>6.341x is organized around eleven units each typically consisting of a set of two to four topics. The source material for learning each topic includes suggested reading in the course text, clarifying notes, other related reading, and video excerpts and will include an interactive on-line discussion forum. The course text is the widely used text by Oppenheim and Schafer (third edition), available on the course website in viewable format. The video segments are adapted from live video recordings of the MIT residential course.&#xA0;<br>\n<br>\nEach topic includes a set of automatically-graded exercises for self-assessment and to help in digesting and understanding the basics of the topic, and in some cases to preview topics. A typical unit in the course concludes with a set of more extensive problems to help in integrating the topics and developing a deeper understanding. Automatic grading of your answers to these problems as well as solutions will be provided.</p>\n\n<p>Cite this course as</p>\n\n<p>Alan V. Oppenheim and Thomas A.

Students appreciate our unique approach to teaching linear algebra because:</p>\n\n<ul><li>It&#x2019;s visual.</li>\n\t<li>It connects hand calculations, mathematical abstractions, and computer programming.</li>\n\t<li>It illustrates the development of mathematical theory.</li>\n\t<li>It&#x2019;s applicable.</li>\n</ul><p>In this course, you will learn all the standard topics that are taught in typical undergraduate linear algebra courses all over the world, but using our unique method, you&apos;ll also get more! LAFF was developed following the syllabus of an introductory linear algebra course at The University of Texas at Austin taught by Professor Robert van de Geijn, an expert on high performance linear algebra libraries. Through short videos, exercises, visualizations, and programming assignments, you will study Vector and Matrix Operations, Linear Transformations, Solving Systems of Equations, Vector Spaces, Linear Least-Squares, and Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors. In addition, you will get a glimpse of cutting edge research on the development of linear algebra libraries, which are used throughout computational science.</p>\n\n<p>We invite you to LAFF with us!</p>',

In session 1, we learnt Linear Lists, Stacks, Queues, Strings, Binary Trees, Trees and Graphs, which are fundamental data structures. In the second session, we will study advanced data structures and algorithms, such as Sorting, Searching, Indexing, as well as their applications thoroughly. More detailed, these chapters include a variety of classic Sorting algorithms (Quicksort, External Sorting), Searching methods (Sets, Hash Tables, Bitmaps), Indexing structures (B/B+ trees, Trie trees), Advanced List-Structure (generalized lists, Multi-dimensional arrays) and Balanced Binary Trees (AVL, Red-Black trees, Splay trees).

Among other features, functional languages offer a compact notation for writing programs, powerful abstraction methods for structuring programs, and a simple mathematical basis that supports reasoning about programs. Functional languages represent the leading edge of programming language design, and the primary setting in which new programming concepts are introduced and studied. All contemporary programming languages such as Hack/PHP, C#, Visual Basic, F#, C++, JavaScript, Python, Ruby, Java, Scala, Clojure, Groovy, Racket, &#x2026; support higher-order programming via the concept of closures or lambda expressions. This course will use Haskell as the medium for understanding the basic principles of functional programming. While the specific language isn&apos;t all that important, Haskell is a pure functional language so it is entirely appropriate for learning the essential ingredients of programming using mathematical functions. It is also a relatively small language, and hence it should be easy for you to get up to speed with Haskell. Once you understand the Why, What and How that underlies pure functional programming and learned to &#x201C;think like a fundamentalist&#x201D;, we will apply the concepts of functional programming to &#x201C;code like a hacker&#x201D; in mainstream programming languages, using Facebook&#x2019;s novel Hack language as our main example. This course assumes no prior knowledge of functional programming, but assumes you have at least one year of programming experience in a regular programming language such as Java, .NET, Javascript or PHP.

Controlling nonlinear systems without complete control authority requires methods that can reason about and exploit the natural dynamics of our machines.<br><br>\nThis course introduces nonlinear dynamics and control of underactuated mechanical systems, with an emphasis on computational methods. Topics include the nonlinear dynamics of robotic manipulators, applied optimal and robust control and motion planning. Discussions include examples from biology and applications to legged locomotion, compliant manipulation, underwater robots, and flying machines.</p>',

We cover the three main programming paradigms : functional, object-oriented, and declarative dataflow.</p>\n\n<p>The two courses are targeted toward people with a basic knowledge of programming. It will be most useful to beginning programming students, but the unconventional approach should be insightful even to seasoned professionals.</p>\n\n<p>Louv1.1x covers fundamental concepts. You&#x2019;ll learn functional programming, its techniques and its data structures. You&#x2019;ll use simple formal semantics for all concepts, and see those concepts illustrated with practical code that runs on the accompanying open-source platform, the Mozart Programming System.</p>\n\n<p>Louv1.2x covers data abstraction, state, and concurrency. You&#x2019;ll learn the four ways to do data abstraction and discuss the trade-offs between objects and abstract data types. You&#x2019;ll be exposed to deterministic dataflow, the most useful paradigm for concurrent programming, and learn how it avoids race conditions.</p>\n\n<p>To learn more about the practical organization of the two courses, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_39rZArLYc&amp;feature=youtu.be">watch the introductory video</a>.</p>\n\n<p>At the end of Louv1.1x and Louv1.2x, the successful participant will be able to :</p>\n\n<ul><li>Specify problems, break them down into their basic steps, and design algorithms and abstractions to solve them</li>\n\t<li>Choose the right programming paradigm and write a program in this paradigm to solve a problem</li>\n\t<li>Use formal semantics to reason about program correctness</li>\n\t<li>Write small concurrent programs in the deterministic dataflow paradigm</li>\n</ul>',

This course aims to make this cutting-edge material broadly accessible to undergraduate students, including computer science majors who do not have any prior exposure to quantum mechanics. The course starts with a simple introduction to the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics using the concepts of qubits (or quantum bits) and quantum gates. This treatment emphasizes the paradoxical nature of the subject, including entanglement, non-local correlations, the no-cloning theorem and quantum teleportation. The course covers the fundamentals of quantum algorithms, including the quantum fourier transform, period finding, Shor&apos;s quantum algorithm for factoring integers, as well as the prospects for quantum algorithms for NP-complete problems.

This course will examine architecture through time, beginning with First Societies and extending to the 15th century. Though the course is chronological, it is not intended as a linear narrative, but rather aims to provide a more global view, by focusing on different architectural &quot;moments.&quot; The lectures will give students the appropriate grounding for understanding a range of buildings and contexts. The material in the lectures will be supplemented by readings from the textbook <em>A Global History of Architecture</em>. Each lecture analyzes a particular architectural transformation arising from a dynamic cultural situation. How did the introduction of iron in the ninth century BCE impact regional politics and the development of architecture? How did new religious formations, such as Buddhism and Hinduism, produce new architectural understandings? What were the architectural consequences of the changing political landscape in northern Italy in the 14th century? How did rock-cut architecture move across space and time from West Asia to India to Africa? How did the emergence of corn impact the rise of religious and temple construction in Mexico? These are typical questions that the lectures will address.</p>\n\n<p>All required readings are available within the courseware, courtesy of Wiley.

Smart City has emerged as an interdisciplinary concept that covers different aspects related to big cities, including the infrastructure that enables communication between channels and entities for overcoming economic backwardness in a community, and for addressing differences between various urban and suburban zones. A dynamic model is observed that can be analyzed as a complex system.

He will explain how to assess yield gaps at the level of fields and production systems around the world, contributing to efficient resource management. *With help of a simulation model , the &#x2018;Crop Growth Simulator&#x2019;, and a hands-on experiment in crop growth at home, you get the possibility to put the &apos;principals of theoretical production ecology&apos; in practice. *Wageningen University and Research, through its unique systems-based approach to food systems, adds the phase of primary production to the broad context of global food security.</span></p>\n\n<p>Like us on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Wageningen-University-GFFCx/866105240069115">Facebook</a> and follow us on <a href="https://twitter.com/GFFCxMOOC">Twitter</a>!</p>',

Virtually every day brings news about some &#x201C;miracle food&#x201D; that we should be consuming or some &quot;poison&quot; we should be avoiding. One day it&apos;s tomatoes to prevent cancer, then flaxseed against heart disease or soybeans for menopause. At the same time we may be warned about trans fats, genetically modified foods, aspartame or MSG. Dietary supplements may be touted as the key to health or a factor in morbidity. According to some, dairy products are indispensable while others urge us to avoid them. The same goes for meat, wheat and soy; the list goes on. This course will shed light on the molecules that constitute our macro and micro nutrients and will attempt to clarify a number of the food issues using the best science available. Other topics to be presented will include the diet-cancer relationship, the link between diet and cardiovascular disease, food-borne illnesses, food additives and weight control.</p>',

Every day you hear about a new fad diet with an &#x201C;unprecedented&#x201D; success rate that promises a long and healthy life or simply causes your fat to melt away. Most people lack a basic understanding of nutritional science to judge whether these messages carry any credibility. Under the mantra &#x201C;you are what you eat&#x201D; this course will teach you the basics of human nutrition and provide you with a solid background to understand and appreciate the importance of nutrition for human health.</p>\n\n<p>This introductory academic course in nutrition provides you with a broad view of the field of nutritional science. Wageningen University has one of the largest academic units in nutritional science worldwide and a long and strong history of excellence in nutrition research. In this course Professor Sander Kersten will teach you what is in our foods, what happens to these components once you consume them, and how these components may impact your health. The course will help you become more critical and provide you with the necessary tools to better weigh and interpret the information overload about nutrition and health.</p>\n\n<p>Like us on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/NUTR101x">Facebook</a> and follow us on <a href="https://twitter.com/NUTR101xMOOC">Twitter</a>!</p>',

If you work with young children, you are not alone in your feelings! Increasing evidence suggests that an effective approach to addressing problem behavior is the adoption of a model that focuses on promoting social-emotional development, providing support for children&#x2019;s appropriate behavior, and preventing challenging behavior. In this class, you will learn a framework for addressing the social and emotional development and challenging behavior of young children.</p>\n\n<p>The overarching goal of this course is to learn evidence-based practices to support the social and emotional development of infants and young children. We will read current research on the developmental trajectory of children with early-onset aggressive behaviors; positive behavior support program models; and intervention efforts that promote positive early childhood mental health. Evidence-based classroom management skills will also be studied and you will leave the course with a solid understanding of how to design supportive environments. This course incorporates a community with which you can learn from others, share your own current approaches and discuss your attempts to incorporate the learnings of this course into your early childhood practice.</p>',

  'short-desc': 'Pragmatic randomized controlled trials reliably work out which of several healthcare interventions works best under real-world conditions.',
  description: '<p>For the first hundreds of years of modern medicine, progress was a process of trial and error, and to be honest, it was often fatal error, such as bloodletting, which killed the first US president George Washington. Where diseases were clearly understood, and where treatments obviously worked on most patients, such as penicillin for pneumonia, there was no need to delve deeper into questions of effectiveness. But for most conditions, the treatment benefits were modest and there was a need for improved ways of telling whether a new intervention was better than the previous standard treatment. And so scientists introduced a testing procedure for new treatments - the randomized controlled trial.</p>\n\n<p>As the cost of developing new treatments grew, it became very important to detect the slightest improvement that could be attributed to the new drug in order to get it licensed and marketed. So the usual randomized trial was answering the following question: does this treatment work (for otherwise well people with just this single disease, with perfect adherence, treated by the best doctors, under idealised conditions)? But most patients have multiple diseases, imperfect adherence, ordinary doctors and non-ideal circumstances. These patients want to know whether a new treatment is likely to reduce important harms for ordinary people like them, receiving usual care. This mismatch meant that most trials were overestimating the real world effectiveness of new interventions.</p>\n\n<p>In this MOOC, we are going to study this mismatch, and see what its effect is on modern medical care. One example of the studies we will discuss is the VIGOR trial. This influential drug trial resulted in the widespread global overuse of this drug, at a cost of wasted billions of dollars. Ironically, this drug, intended to reduce a problem in individuals, ended up causing more of the same problem in the population!</p>\n\n<p>After we understand the consequences of designing the wrong kinds of trials, we will also look at how best to design pragmatic randomized trials, which answer the important questions that ordinary patients and decision makers in the real world most often ask. We will also explore how these can be combined with economic evaluations and qualitative research &#x2013; to answer important questions about how much these interventions cost, and how they are experienced by the recipients.</p>',

We often feel motivated for change when we experience imbalance in life. One example of a key concept that helps us understand how imbalance arises is the effort-reward model, which states that ill-health is more likely to arise when there is a gap between the effort you make and how you are rewarded. To help people who are experiencing imbalance identify what they need to change, we will learn about Motivational Interviewing (MI), a counseling style that stimulates behavior change. You will have an opportunity to test basic techniques in MI with a &#x201C;virtual bartender&#x201D; who has sleep problems that he is trying to solve by drinking alcohol. The following four weeks will focus on coping with stress (week 2), improving sleep (week 3), increasing physical activity (week 4), and everyday behaviors (week 5) like hand washing, condom use and minimizing risky alcohol use.</p>\n\n<p>To complete this course, you will need to set aside about 5-8 hours a week. You&#x2019;ll use some of this time to watch course videos, answer questions designed to help you reinforce and retain what you have learned, and understand the homework required. The remaining time will be for course reading, mostly open access scientific articles, and solving homework tasks. You&#x2019;ll be doing part of the work together with other participants in the course community.

Students are welcome to audit the course, and participate in all course activities. Certificates will not be issued.</em></p>\n\n<p>Everyone experiences adversity and stress at some level, whether it&#x2019;s the pressure to perform in school or work, relationship problems, financial difficulties, or simply the number of tasks to do in a short period of time. All stress isn&#x2019;t bad, but chronic stress can take its toll on our minds, bodies, and behavior. Research has shown that people can learn and use specific resilience skills (such as optimistic thinking, relaxation strategies, choosing one&#x2019;s attention) and positive routines (good sleep, scheduling in fun, and so on) in order to better manage stress, bounce back quicker after a setback, be more effective in their academic and vocational pursuits, develop stronger relationships with others, be physically and mentally healthy, and be satisfied with their lives overall. In short, resilience is ordinary magic and can be learned. It does not necessarily mean that you have to be born resilient or get lucky in life.</p>\n\n<p>The purpose of this course is to teach individuals the science behind becoming a resilient person. Stated simply, resilience is the ability to survive and thrive. Resiliency is not only about your ability to positively adapt in the face of adverse or challenging circumstances (that is, survive), but it is also about learning the positive skills, strategies and routines that enable you to live a happy, fulfilling, and meaningful life (in other words, thrive). This course gives you the permission to take care of yourself in order to effectively manage life stressors and do what matters most in life. This captures the notion of being from the inside out, which is a phrase that highlights the importance of promoting core resilience skills, strategies, and routines among early childhood educators. In turn, resilient people are more capable of creating and maintaining nurturing, supportive, and effective learning environments while also optimizing their own wellbeing and love for both the big and small things in life.</p>\n\n<p>By the end of this course, you will have learned about the knowledge and skills that you can apply in your life now and in the future to be a resilient person.</p>\n\n<p><u>Course goal:</u></p>\n\n<p>The goal for this course is to give you permission to take care of yourself and empower you to be a resilient person. A resilient person is someone who:</p>\n\n<ul><li>purposely strives to be as mentally and psychically healthy as possible,</li>\n\t<li>possesses the confidence to effectively cope with and manage stressful situations,</li>\n\t<li>is compassionate towards self and others,</li>\n\t<li>demonstrates grit or perseverance even in the face of adversity, and</li>\n\t<li>focuses on the positive and fulfilling aspects of life.</li>\n</ul><p><u>Course supporting objectives: </u>When you complete this course, you will be able to:</p>\n\n<ul><li>Describe why &#x2018;functioning from the inside out&#x2019; is critical to becoming a resilient, effective person\n\t<ul><li>Explain the benefits of resilience and how the specific skills translate into optimizing social-emotional wellbeing and doing what matters most in life</li>\n\t</ul></li>\n\t<li>Directly practice a variety of resilience skills in different aspects of your life, including but not limited to:\n\t<ul><li>Mindfulness practices</li>\n\t\t<li>Strategies to manage intense emotions</li>\n\t\t<li>Activities that induce positive emotions</li>\n\t\t<li>Clarifying important personal values (that is, what matters most) and committing to behaving consistent with them</li>\n\t\t<li>Making health lifestyle choices that are cheap and readily available, yet promote well-being</li>\n\t</ul></li>\n\t<li>Describe why &#x2018;practicing&#x2019; and integrating resilience skills into one&#x2019;s life is critical to making them a habit and becoming a resilient person</li>\n\t<li>Develop a resilience plan that serves as a roadmap for your future</li>\n</ul>',

It aims to frame global health&apos;s collection of problems and actions within a particular biosocial perspective. It develops a toolkit of analytical approaches and uses them to examine historical and contemporary global health initiatives with careful attention to a critical sociology of knowledge. The teaching team, four physician-anthropologists, draws on experiences working in Asia, Africa, Eastern Europe, and the Americas, to investigate what the field of global health may include, how global health problems are defined and constructed, and how global health interventions play out in expected and unexpected ways. The course seeks to inspire and teach the following principles:</p>\n\n<p><em>A global awareness.</em> This course aims to enable students to recognize the role of distinctive traditions, governments, and histories in shaping health and wellbeing. In addition, rather than framing a faceless mass of poor populations as the subject of global health initiatives, the course uses ethnographies and case studies to situate global health problems in relation to the lives of individuals, families, and communities.</p>\n\n<p><em>A grounding in social and historical analysis.</em> The course demonstrates the value of social theory and historical analysis in understanding health and illness at individual and societal levels.</p>\n\n<p><em>An ethical engagement.</em> Throughout the course, students will be asked to critically evaluate the ethical frameworks that have underpinned historical and contemporary engagement in global health. Students will be pushed to consider the moral questions of inequality and suffering as well as to critically evaluate various ethical frameworks that motivate and structure attempts to redress these inequities</p>\n\n<p><em>A sense of inspiration and possibility.</em> While the overwhelming challenges of global health could, all too easily, engender cynicism, passivity, and helplessness, students learn that no matter how complex the field of global health and no matter how steep the challenges, it is possible to design, implement, and foster programs and policies that make enormous positive change in the lives of the world&#x2019;s poorest and suffering people.</p>\n\n<p>HarvardX pursues the science of learning.

Students will learn how the system is structured, how care is organized, delivered, and financed, and how the Affordable Care Act will influence the future of the system. Students will understand the U.S. health policy making structure process at the federal, state, and local levels. Students who complete this course will be able to interpret current controversies around US health policy and develop informed opinions on future policy developments.</p>\n\n<p>HarvardX pursues the science of learning.

Principled investigations to monitor and thus improve the health of individuals are firmly based on a sound understanding of modern quantitative methods. This involves the ability to discover patterns and extract knowledge from health data on a sample of individuals and then to infer, with measured uncertainty, the unobserved population characteristics. This course will address this need by covering the principles of biostatistics and epidemiology used for public health and clinical research. These include outcomes measurement, measures of associations between outcomes and their determinants, study design options, bias and confounding, probability and diagnostic tests, confidence intervals and hypothesis testing, power and sample size determinations, life tables and survival methods, regression methods (both, linear and logistic), and sample survey techniques. Students will analyze sample data sets to acquire knowledge of appropriate computer software.

However, just <em>using</em> a computer is only a small part of the picture. The real transformative and empowering experience comes when one learns how to <em>program</em> the computer, to translate ideas into code. This course teaches students how to do exactly that, using Snap<em>!</em> (based on Scratch), one of the friendliest programming languages ever invented. It&apos;s purely graphical, which means programming involves simply dragging blocks around, and building bigger blocks out of smaller blocks. But this course is far more than just learning to program. We focus on seven big ideas (creativity, abstraction, data and information, algorithms, programming, the Internet, and global impact), and six computational thinking practices (connecting computing, creating computational artifacts, abstracting, analyzing problems and artifacts, communicating, and collaborating).

Unit processes, involved in the treatment chain, are discussed as well as the physical, chemical and biological processes involved. The emphasis is on the effect of treatment on water quality and the dimensions of the &#xA0;unit processes in the treatment chain.&#xA0; After the course one should be able to recognise the process units, describe their function, and make basic calculations for a preliminary design of a drinking water treatment plant.</p>\n\n<p>The course consists of 4 modules:</p>\n\n<ol><li>Introduction to drinking water treatment. In this module you learn to describe the important disciplines, schemes and evaluation criteria involved in the design phase.</li>\n\t<li>Water quality. In this module you learn to identify the drinking water quality parameters to be improved and explain what treatment train or scheme is needed.</li>\n\t<li>Groundwater treatment. In this module you learn to calculate the dimensions of the groundwater treatment processes and draw groundwater treatment schemes.</li>\n\t<li>Surface water treatment. In this module you learn to calculate the dimensions of the surface water treatment processes and draw surface water treatment schemes.</li>\n</ol><p>The course consists of knowledge clips, movies, exercises, discussion and homework assignments. The course will be finished by an examination.

Among other features, functional languages offer a compact notation for writing programs, powerful abstraction methods for structuring programs, and a simple mathematical basis that supports reasoning about programs. Functional languages represent the leading edge of programming language design, and the primary setting in which new programming concepts are introduced and studied. All contemporary programming languages such as Hack/PHP, C#, Visual Basic, F#, C++, JavaScript, Python, Ruby, Java, Scala, Clojure, Groovy, Racket, &#x2026; support higher-order programming via the concept of closures or lambda expressions. This course will use Haskell as the medium for understanding the basic principles of functional programming. While the specific language isn&apos;t all that important, Haskell is a pure functional language so it is entirely appropriate for learning the essential ingredients of programming using mathematical functions. It is also a relatively small language, and hence it should be easy for you to get up to speed with Haskell. Once you understand the Why, What and How that underlies pure functional programming and learned to &#x201C;think like a fundamentalist&#x201D;, we will apply the concepts of functional programming to &#x201C;code like a hacker&#x201D; in mainstream programming languages, using Facebook&#x2019;s novel Hack language as our main example. This course assumes no prior knowledge of functional programming, but assumes you have at least one year of programming experience in a regular programming language such as Java, .NET, Javascript or PHP.

This course will examine architecture through time, beginning with First Societies and extending to the 15th century. Though the course is chronological, it is not intended as a linear narrative, but rather aims to provide a more global view, by focusing on different architectural &quot;moments.&quot; The lectures will give students the appropriate grounding for understanding a range of buildings and contexts. The material in the lectures will be supplemented by readings from the textbook <em>A Global History of Architecture</em>. Each lecture analyzes a particular architectural transformation arising from a dynamic cultural situation. How did the introduction of iron in the ninth century BCE impact regional politics and the development of architecture? How did new religious formations, such as Buddhism and Hinduism, produce new architectural understandings? What were the architectural consequences of the changing political landscape in northern Italy in the 14th century?

Potential applications range from aerial filming over remote visual inspection to automatic 3D reconstruction of buildings. Navigating a quadrotor manually requires a skilled pilot and constant concentration. Therefore, there is a strong scientific interest to develop solutions that enable quadrotors to fly autonomously and without constant human supervision. This is a challenging research problem because the payload of a quadrotor is uttermost constrained and so both the quality of the onboard sensors and the available computing power is strongly limited.</p>\n\n<p>In this course, we will introduce the basic concepts for autonomous navigation for quadrotors including topics such as probabilistic state estimation, linear control, and path planning. You will learn how to infer the position of the quadrotor from its sensor readings, how to navigate along a series of waypoints, and how to plan collision free trajectories. The course consists of a series of weekly lecture videos that we be interleaved by interactive quizzes and hands-on programming tasks. The programming exercises will require you to write small code snippets in Python to make a quadrotor fly in simulation.</p>\n\n<p>This course is intended for graduate students in computer science, electrical engineering or mechanical engineering. The course is based on the TUM lecture &#x201C;Visual Navigation for Flying Robots&#x201D; which received the TUM TeachInf best lecture award in 2012 and 2013.

This course traces how the remarkable concept called energy is the natural way of describing, understanding and unifying these diverse phenomena. The course traces the cascade of energy from sunlight to its final destination in a thermal form, considering differential surface heating, the role of convection and buoyancy and the formation of the Earth&#x2019;s circulation system, and the links to the ocean circulation system. We consider the curvature and rotation of the Earth as key constraints on a system driven by sunlight and energy transformations.</span></p>\n\n<p>Before your course starts, try the new edX Demo where you can explore the fun, interactive learning environment and virtual labs. <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/edx/edxdemo101/edx-demo/1038">Learn more</a>.</p>',

It is designed to address critical areas of composite technologies that focus on materials, manufacturing, mechanics, design, inspection, and repair. &#xA0;In this course students will learn how composite materials achieve properties of strength, weight ratios and durability that surpass aluminum in aircraft design.&#xA0; For these high performance applications engineers typically rely on laminated structures, which are built up from many varying layers of ply-materials. Using this process the mechanical properties of the composite part can be tailored to specific applications resulting in significant weight and cost savings. Tailoring specific properties and designing innovative laminate structures highlights the multidisciplinary nature of this industry and how it touches the expertise of many disciplines including engineers, mechanics, and inspection specialists.</p>\n\n<p>After successfully completing this course, students will be able to identify the unique characteristics of composites and understand how advanced composite structures are designed, manufactured and maintained.</p>\n\n<p><strong>When you have finished this course, you will be able to:</strong></p>\n\n<ul><li>Demonstrate understanding of fundamentals in materials, manufacturing, mechanics, design,&#xA0;and repair of polymeric matrix composites</li>\n\t<li>Identify advantages and disadvantages of polymeric matrix composites with respect to metals</li>\n\t<li>Apply the knowledge acquired&#xA0; to the design and manufacturing of high performance composite structures</li>\n</ul>',

We will consider: linear elasticity (recoverable deformation at small displacements), viscoelasticity (behavior intermediate to that of an elastic solid and that of a viscous fluid), plasticity (permanent deformation), creep in crystalline materials (time dependent behavior), brittle fracture (rapid crack propagation) and fatigue (failure due to repeated loading of a material). Examples are drawn from metals, ceramics, glasses, polymers, biomaterials, composites and cellular materials.</p>',

In many parts of the world we take the availability of these services for granted. Without conscious reflection on the technological systems that bring these services to where we use them, we are becoming increasingly dependent on a secure, uninterrupted and affordable supply of energy, water, transport, telecommunication and information services. They create the conditions for liveability and economic development. However, today&apos;s infrastructure systems are in a process of drastic change, as they are becoming more and more web-based, transnational and privatized, while new technologies are on their way. The outcome of these changes is difficult to predict.</p>\n\n<p>In this course we will explore the challenges of infrastructure design, management and governance for the future. Some of the questions that will be addressed:</p>\n\n<ul><li>What are the major changes and drivers when it comes to infrastructure development?</li>\n\t<li>What makes infrastructure networks vulnerable and how do we manage these risks in the future?</li>\n\t<li>How can their reliability and quality-of-service be improved?</li>\n\t<li>Will they become accessible for all global citizens, always and everywhere?</li>\n\t<li>Will they remain affordable for future generations?</li>\n\t<li>Will they exhaust the natural environment?</li>\n\t<li>Will established infrastructure systems be disrupted by technological innovations?</li>\n\t<li>How about security and privacy?</li>\n</ul><p>In this course you will learn to look at these challenges from a new combined engineering and social science perspective. We will explain, for example, how public values are expressed in infrastructure design, and how regulation dictates technology choices. It is all about dealing with complexity in the design, management and governance of infrastructure.</p>\n\n<p>If you are interested or involved in the functioning of today&apos;s and tomorrow&apos;s (next generation) infrastructures, this course is an exceptional learning opportunity, whether you are a student or a professional.

What is the potential of so-called smart grids? How to design infrastructure for the smart cities of the future?</p>\n\n<p>The course is based on the results of an extensive and renowned international research programme titled &apos;<a href="http://www.nextgenerationinfrastructures.eu/index.php?pageID=1&amp;language=en" target="_blank">Next Generation Infrastructures</a>&apos; (NGInfra).

He continues to reinvent himself to create modern global superheroes and appear in cameos in superhero films and TV, such as <em>Avengers: Age of Ultron.</em></li>\n\t<li>Michael Uslan, executive producer of top grossing, award winning movies, including <em>The Dark Knight</em> series, <em>Lego</em><sup>&#xAE;</sup><em> Movie</em>, the animated Batman films and <em>Batman</em><sup>&#xAE;</sup><em> VS Superman</em>.&#xA0;</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In this course, we explore the following questions:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Why did superheroes first arise in 1938 and experience what we refer to as their &#x201C;Golden Age&#x201D; during World War II?</li>\n\t<li>Why did the superhero genre ebb and flow in popularity over the decades?</li>\n\t<li>How have comic books, published weekly since the mid-1930&#x2019;s, mirrored a changing American society, reflecting our mores, slang, fads, biases and prejudices?&#xA0;</li>\n\t<li>Why was the comic book industry nearly shut down in the McCarthy Era of the 1950&#x2019;s?&#xA0;</li>\n\t<li>How did our superheroes become super-villains in the eyes of the government, clergy, educators, and parents of the mid-20<sup>th</sup> Century?&#xA0;</li>\n\t<li>When and how did comic books become acceptable again, and eventually become valid teaching tools in universities and schools?&#xA0;</li>\n\t<li>When and how did comic book artwork become accepted as a true American art form as indigenous to this country as jazz?&#xA0;</li>\n\t<li>Finally, when and how did comic books become &#x201C;cool&#x201D; and the basis for blockbuster movies, hit TV series, top-selling video games, and acclaimed animation, while also impacting fashion and style- and even the moral and ethical codes of children- around the globe?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>For the first time ever, the Smithsonian&apos;s National Museum of American History is excited to offer the opportunity to go into the collection and see why superheroes are a dominant cultural force in today&#x2019;s world. Not only will students be taught by Smithsonian experts, and three industry leaders - Stan Lee, Michael Uslan and David Uslan, but they will also get to ask questions and chat online with them around coursework.

It is an exercise in the deliberation of issues, persuasion, and the polling of results. JuryX: Deliberations for Social Change is an invitation to explore the concept of jury in both in theory and in practice, exploring both the political theory and history of the jury as well as techniques for engaging in juristic discussion.</p>\n<p>The course consists of six modules. In each module, you will begin by engaging with a case on your own, much like a jury views evidence, before engaging in small group discussions with your peers about the topic at hand. The course begins with historical legal cases and then moves to major contemporary issues. These include: decriminalization of marijuana in Jamaica and worldwide efforts to legalize, the potential for the Olympics and World Cup to advance education, individual identity and anonymity surrounding the NSA leak by Edward Snowden, and lethal police action against young black men, crystallized in the hashtag #icantbreathe.</p>\n<p>Deliberations will be real and virtual, synchronous and asynchronous. &#x2028;Cases will be hosted on the edX platform, but deliberation groups will meet in a variety of media best suited to each group. The supported deliberation environment for online synchronous deliberation will be &#x2018;Unhangout,&#x2019; a video-based discussion tool developed at the MIT Media Lab. Many other opportunities for gathering, deliberating, and returning results are also available, including face-to-face gathering and asynchronous deliberation online using open social media like Facebook and Loomio.</p>\n<p>JuryX: Deliberations for Social Change is ultimately about the most fundamental of human interactions: communication.

  description: '<p>The goal of this course is to help students become familiar with the leading European painters and paintings from approximately 1400 to 1800, and with the issues that found expression in the art of painting. Included in this broad timeframe are artists of the importance of Leonardo da Vinci, Caravaggio, Vel&#xE1;zquez, Rembrandt, Vermeer or Goya. Painters during this period were concerned with ideas such as the pursuit of beauty, the pleasures and pains associated with love, the demonstration of power and status, or the relationship of men and women to the divinity and to nature. In paintings from the period covered in this course we find traces of the emergence of the modern mind set, and information on issues such as the respective roles of women and men in the world. The classes will focus on images of paintings by the artists listed in the course syllabus. The discussions that will take place in the &#x201C;course forum&#x201D; will allow us to touch upon a broader range of issues.<br><br><a href="http://courses.edx.org/c4x/UC3Mx/CEH.1-ENx/asset/CEH.1-ENx-Syllabus.pdf">More information</a></p>',

The fifth and final module in <em>The Ancient Greek Hero in 24 Hours</em>, &#x201C;Hours 22-24: Plato and Beyond&#x201D; challenges the idea that Socrates was a hero, just as Plato&#x2019;s&#xA0;Socrates himself challenges&#xA0;that same idea. And yet, as we will see from reading Plato&#x2019;s&#xA0;Apology of&#xA0;Socrates&#xA0;and&#xA0;Phaedo, the idea of the hero is very&#xA0;much present in Plato&#x2019;s works &#x2013; just as it persists in&#xA0;works beyond Plato,&#xA0;whether or not these works adopt Plato&#x2019;s project of trying to substitute&#xA0;philosophy for&#xA0;literature (especially for poetry). Just as poetry serves as a&#xA0;primary representative for the idea of the hero,&#xA0;we will discover though our&#xA0;close readings that the philosophical prose of Plato likewise represents this&#xA0;same idea - though now the hero is no longer some superhuman human. Rather, the&#xA0;real hero now&#xA0;becomes the word of philosophical dialogue, which is brought back&#xA0;to life much as a cult hero is brought&#xA0;back to life ever time a heroic life is&#xA0;narrated or dramatized. In Plato&#x2019;s works, the narration and the&#xA0;dramatization&#xA0;show not the life of the hero but the life of the word that survives the&#xA0;speaker of the word,&#xA0;provided that the word engages in dialogue &#x2013; a&#xA0;philosophical dialogue that contemplates the eternal truths&#xA0;of the cosmos.&#xA0;<br>\n&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;<br><strong>See other courses in this series:</strong><br><a href="https://www.edx.org/course/harvardx/harvardx-hum2-1x-ancient-greek-hero-24-3131">Module 1, &#x201C;Hours 1-5: Epic and Lyric&#x201D;</a><br><a href="https://www.edx.org/course/harvardx/harvardx-hum2-2x-ancient-greek-hero-24-3431">Module 2, &#x201C;Hours 6-11: Signs of the Hero in Epic and Iconography&#x201D;</a><br><a href="https://www.edx.org/course/harvardx/harvardx-hum2-3x-ancient-greek-hero-24-3916" target="_blank">Module 3, &#x201C;Hours 12-15: Cult of Heroes&#x201D;</a><br><a href="https://www.edx.org/course/harvardx/harvardx-hum2-4x-ancient-greek-hero-24-4011" target="_blank">Module 4, &#x201C;Hours 16-21: The Hero in Tragedy&#x201D;</a></p>\n\n<p>HarvardX pursues the science of learning.

The fourth of five modules in <em>The Ancient Greek Hero in 24 Hours</em>, &#x201C;Hours 16-21: The Hero in Tragedy&#x201D; finds us in the world of high classical poetry in drama,&#xA0;as brought to life&#xA0;in three tragedies of Aeschylus, two of Sophocles, and two of Euripides. We see&#xA0;here&#xA0;the Greek hero as best known to us from the perspective of world&#xA0;literature. The medium of drama makes&#xA0;heroes seem more familiar to us, since we&#xA0;think we know drama better than we know other verbal arts&#xA0;such as epic and&#xA0;lyric, but, by the time we finish analyzing the seven classical tragedies that&#xA0;we will be&#xA0;reading, we will see that the traditions of hero cult, infused into&#xA0;the verbal art of drama, cast an altogether&#xA0;new light on tragedy, defamiliarizing&#xA0;for us not only the heroes illuminated by this art but also the art itself.&#xA0;We&#xA0;will see, then, maybe for the first time ever, that the ancient Greek hero of&#xA0;tragedy was not at all like&#xA0;us &#x2013; even less like us than the hero of epic or&#xA0;lyric. The male and female heroes of drama were larger than&#xA0;life, far more so&#xA0;than we may ever have imagined, reaching levels of both nobility and debasement&#xA0;that&#xA0;challenge our sense of equilibrium in the cosmos. As our close readings of&#xA0;our seven chosen tragedies&#xA0;will show, there was a disequilibrium in myths about&#xA0;heroes in the remote past, and this disequilibrium&#xA0;could be compensated only by&#xA0;experiencing the equilibrium of rituals in the immediate present &#x2013; rituals&#xA0;culminating in the drama of heroic tragedy.<br>\n&#xA0;<br><strong>See other courses in this series:</strong><br><a href="https://www.edx.org/course/harvardx/harvardx-hum2-1x-ancient-greek-hero-24-3131">Module 1, &#x201C;Hours 1-5: Epic and Lyric&#x201D;</a><br><a href="https://www.edx.org/course/harvardx/harvardx-hum2-2x-ancient-greek-hero-24-3431">Module 2, &#x201C;Hours 6-11: Signs of the Hero in Epic and Iconography&#x201D;</a><br><a href="https://www.edx.org/course/harvardx/harvardx-hum2-3x-ancient-greek-hero-24-3916" target="_blank">Module 3, &#x201C;Hours 12-15: Cult of Heroes&#x201D;</a><br><a href="https://www.edx.org/course/harvardx/harvardx-hum2-5x-ancient-greek-hero-24-4026" target="_blank">Module 5, &#x201C;Hours 22-24: Plato and Beyond&#x201D;</a><br><br>\nHarvardX pursues the science of learning.

This course will examine architecture through time, beginning with First Societies and extending to the 15th century. Though the course is chronological, it is not intended as a linear narrative, but rather aims to provide a more global view, by focusing on different architectural &quot;moments.&quot; The lectures will give students the appropriate grounding for understanding a range of buildings and contexts. The material in the lectures will be supplemented by readings from the textbook <em>A Global History of Architecture</em>. Each lecture analyzes a particular architectural transformation arising from a dynamic cultural situation. How did the introduction of iron in the ninth century BCE impact regional politics and the development of architecture? How did new religious formations, such as Buddhism and Hinduism, produce new architectural understandings? What were the architectural consequences of the changing political landscape in northern Italy in the 14th century? How did rock-cut architecture move across space and time from West Asia to India to Africa? How did the emergence of corn impact the rise of religious and temple construction in Mexico? These are typical questions that the lectures will address.</p>\n\n<p>All required readings are available within the courseware, courtesy of Wiley.

The second of five modules in <em>The Ancient Greek Hero in 24 Hours</em>, &#x201C;Hours 6-11: Signs of the Hero in Epic and Iconography&#x201D; explores the interactions of text and image in a culture where the &#x201C;text&#x201D; is not a written document but a live performance and where the &#x201C;image&#x201D; is not based on anything that is written down but exists as a free-standing medium of the visual arts, expressing the same myths that are being systematically expressed by the medium of Homeric poetry. Almost all of the images we will be studying are samples of a form of vase painting known as the &#x201C;Black Figure&#x201D; technique. We will practice how to &#x201C;read&#x201D; such a medium, analyzing what it tells us about ancient Greek heroes like Achilles, in conjunction with our &#x201C;reading&#x201D; the performance tradition of the Homeric Iliad itself.</p>\n\n<p>It is important to keep in mind, as we read these images and texts together, that the myths expressed by these media were meant to be taken very seriously. In the ancient Greek song culture, myth was not mere fiction. Just the opposite: myth was a formulation of eternal cosmic truths! So, the myths conveyed by the images of the paintings we will study are just as &#x201C;truthful,&#x201D; from the standpoint of ancient Greek song culture, as are the related myths conveyed by the Homeric Iliad. We need to read both the texts and the images of these myths as an accurate formulation of an integral system of thought the expresses most clearly and authoritatively all those things that really matter in life.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, this module foregrounds the historical fact, explored more fully in the third module (&#x201C;Hours 12-15: The Cult of Heroes&#x201D;), that the heroes who were characters in the myths of ancient Greek epic, lyric, and other verbal media were at the same time worshipped as superhuman forces by the communities where their bodies were thought to be hidden from outsiders. When we take for example the Homeric <em>Odyssey</em>, we find that the main hero of this epic, Odysseus, was a cult hero, not only an epic hero. And the agenda that center on the idea of a cult hero, like the prospect of immortalization after death, can be clearly seen in the overall plot of the <em>Odyssey</em>, especially in the memorable scene where the hero experiences his homecoming to Ithaca at the same moment when the sun rises as he wakes from a mystical overnight sleep while sailing homeward.</p>\n\n<p><strong>See other courses in this series:</strong><br>\n<a href="https://www.edx.org/course/harvardx/harvardx-hum2-1x-ancient-greek-hero-24-3131" target="_blank">Module 1, &#x201C;Hours 1-5: Epic and Lyric&#x201D;</a><br>\n<a href="https://www.edx.org/course/harvardx/harvardx-hum2-3x-ancient-greek-hero-24-3916" target="_blank">Module 3, &#x201C;Hours 12-15: Cult of Heroes&#x201D;</a><br>\n<a href="https://www.edx.org/course/harvardx/harvardx-hum2-4x-ancient-greek-hero-24-4011" target="_blank">Module 4, &#x201C;Hours 16-21: The Hero in Tragedy&#x201D;</a><br>\n<a href="https://www.edx.org/course/harvardx/harvardx-hum2-5x-ancient-greek-hero-24-4026" target="_blank">Module 5, &#x201C;Hours 22-24: Plato and Beyond&#x201D;</a></p>\n<p>HarvardX pursues the science of learning.

This initial mini-course seeks to answer the following question: How did a school system, once the envy of the world, stumble so that the performance in math, science, and reading of U.S. students at age 15 fell below that of students in a majority of the world&#x2019;s industrialized nations?</p>\n\n<p>Exploring that question, we identify the personalities and historical forces&#x2014;the progressives, racial desegregation, legalization and collective bargaining&#x2014;that shaped and re-shaped U.S. school politics and policy.&#xA0;We visit the places where new ideas and practices were spawned, and we look at some of their unanticipated consequences.&#xA0;</p>\n\n<p>In the three subsequent mini-courses, we seek answers to a second question: What are the best ways of lifting the performance of American schools to a higher level? To explore these questions, we look at ideas and proposals of those who want to save our schools&#x2014;be it by reforming the teaching profession, holding schools accountable, or giving families more school choices.&#xA0; In interviews with reform proponents and independent experts, we capture the intensity of the current debate.&#xA0;In the end, we do not find any silver bullets that can magically lift schools to a new level of performance, but we do pinpoint the pluses and minuses of many new approaches.&#xA0; These three subsequent mini-courses will launch later in the fall and continue into 2015.</p>\n\n<p>Each mini-course contains five to eight lectures, with each lecture containing approximately three videos.

The course is based on the MIT &quot;Visualizing Cultures&quot; website devoted to image-driven research on Japan and China since the 19th century (<a href="http://visualizingcultures.mit.edu/">visualizingcultures.mit.edu</a>). The introductory module considers methodologies historians use to &#x201C;visualize&#x201D; the past, followed by three modules that explore the themes of Westernization, in Commodore Perry&#x2019;s 1853-54 expedition to Japan; social protest, in Tokyo&#x2019;s 1905 Hibiya Riot; and modernity, as seen in the archives of the major Japanese cosmetics company, Shiseido.</p>\n\n<p>Module 0: Introduction: New Historical Sources for a Digital Age (Professors Dower, Gordon, Miyagawa). Digitization has dramatically altered historians&apos; access to primary sources, making large databases of the visual record readily accessible. How is historical methodology changing in response to this seismic shift? How can scholars, students, and the general public make optimal use of these new digital resources?</p>\n\n<p>Module 1: Black Ships &amp; Samurai (Professor Dower). Commodore Matthew Perry&apos;s 1853-54 expedition to force Japan to open its doors to the outside world is an extraordinary moment to look at by examining and comparing the visual representations left to us by both the American and Japanese sides of this encounter. This module also addresses the rapid Westernization undertaken by Japan in the half century following the Perry mission.</p>\n\n<p>Module 2: Social Protest in Imperial Japan: The Hibiya Riot of 1905 (Professor Gordon). The dramatic daily reports from participants in the massive &quot;Hibiya Riot&quot; in 1905, the first major social protest in the age of &quot;imperial democracy&quot; in Japan, offer a vivid and fresh perspective on the contentious domestic politics of an emerging imperial power.</p>\n\n<p>Module 3: Modernity in Interwar Japan: Shiseido &amp; Consumer Culture (Professors Dower, Gordon, Weisenfeld). Exploring the vast archives of the Shiseido cosmetics company opens a fascinating window on the emergence of consumer culture, modern roles for women, and global cosmopolitanism from the &apos;teens through the 1920s and even into the era of Japanese militarism and aggression in the 1930s. This module will also tap other Visualizing Cultures units on modernization and modernity.</p>\n\n<p>NOTES:</p>\n\n<p><a href="https://www.edx.org/course/utokyox/utokyox-utokyo001x-visualizing-postwar-1545">UTokyo001x: Visualizing Postwar Tokyo</a>, by University of Tokyo, follows in this series.</p>\n\n<p>For MIT students: VJx will be part 21F.027J Visualizing Japan in the Modern World, a residential course taught by Professor Miyagawa, Fall 2014.</p>\n\n<p>In addition to MITx and HarvardX, this project is supported by the U.S. Japan Foundation, the University of Tokyo, and the Reischauer Institute of Japanese Studies, Harvard University.</p>\n\n<p>HarvardX pursues the science of learning.

The third of five modules in <em>The Ancient Greek Hero in 24 Hours</em>, &#x201C;Hours 12-15: Cult of Heroes&#x201D; explores the vast variety of perspectives brought to bear on&#xA0;the idea of the&#xA0;ancient Greek hero in the versatile medium of prose, as exemplified by authors&#xA0;as varied&#xA0;as Herodotus, the so-called father of history, and Philostratus, an&#xA0;intellectual from a post-classical period&#xA0;who was prodigiously well-versed in classical&#xA0;and pre-classical lore about cult heroes.</p>\n\n<p>In&#xA0;Homeric poetry the idea of hero cult is implicit even though&#xA0;characters like Odysseus are not&#xA0;explicitly identified as cult heroes. The&#xA0;situation is different, however, in the poetry attributed to Hesiod,&#xA0;where the&#xA0;very idea of a cult hero is precisely outlined and illustrated, especially in&#xA0;the myth about the five&#xA0;generations of humankind. As we will see from&#xA0;the lively prose&#xA0;narratives of such learned and captivating authors as Herodotus and Philostratus, the mystique of cult heroes,&#xA0;both male&#xA0;and female, enthralled their adoring worshippers, who treasured the exotic&#xA0;stories of epiphanies and&#xA0;miracles that were linked with the places made sacred&#xA0;by the felt presence of heroes residing in the&#xA0;mother earth that concealed&#xA0;their bodies. We will even get the chance to read and analyze an&#xA0;eyewitness prose account of an actual initiation into the mysteries of a hero cult.&#xA0;This prose account&#xA0;brings home to us the seriousness of personally experiencing&#xA0;such an initiation, and it shows the&#xA0;emotional impact of making contact with&#xA0;the consciousness of superhuman forces that inhabit the&#xA0;mystical world of hero&#xA0;cult.</p>\n\n<p><strong>See other courses in this series:</strong><br>\n<a href="https://www.edx.org/course/harvardx/harvardx-hum2-1x-ancient-greek-hero-24-3131" target="_blank">Module 1, &#x201C;Hours 1-5: Epic and Lyric&#x201D;</a><br>\n<a href="https://www.edx.org/course/harvardx/harvardx-hum2-2x-ancient-greek-hero-24-3431" target="_blank">Module 2, &#x201C;Hours 6-11: Signs of the Hero in Epic and Iconography&#x201D;</a><br>\n<a href="https://www.edx.org/course/harvardx/harvardx-hum2-4x-ancient-greek-hero-24-4011" target="_blank">Module 4, &#x201C;Hours 16-21: The Hero in Tragedy&#x201D;</a><br>\n<a href="https://www.edx.org/course/harvardx/harvardx-hum2-5x-ancient-greek-hero-24-4026" target="_blank">Module 5, &#x201C;Hours 22-24: Plato and Beyond&#x201D;</a></p>\n<p>HarvardX pursues the science of learning.

The first of five modules on The Ancient Greek Hero, &#x201C;Epic and Lyric&#x201D; looks at ancient Greek heroes from the perspective of two different but related media of poetry and songmaking, <em>epic</em> and <em>lyric</em>. The major focus is Achilles, especially as viewed through the lens of the Homeric <em>Iliad</em> <u>and</u> through the &#x201C;rose-colored glasses&#x201D; of Sappho&#x2019;s songs. While the epic of the <em>Iliad</em> is typical of verbal art that is performed by and for men, the lyric songs of Sappho derive from traditions of singing performed mainly by women of all ages, including adolescents about to be initiated into womanhood. These &#x201C;women&#x2019;s traditions&#x201D; are best known for two kinds of singing, laments and love songs, which are interchangeable in contexts that will surprise the modern mind. Another surprise, as we will see, is that the <em>Iliad</em> too contains embedded &#x201C;quotations&#x201D; of such laments and love songs, and that our first impression of this epic as a &#x201C;men&#x2019;s tradition&#x201D; obscures the fact that Homeric poetry channels the songs of women as well as men. A perfect expression of such &#x201C;channeling&#x201D; is the figure of Achilles himself, who was admired by Greek song culture as a virtuoso singer of laments and love songs in his own right. An analysis of Homeric passages that &#x201C;quote&#x201D; the singing of Achilles will be an integral part of our overall experience in close reading.</p>\n\n<p><strong>See other courses in this series:</strong><br><a href="https://www.edx.org/course/harvardx/harvardx-hum2-2x-ancient-greek-hero-24-3431" target="_blank">Module 2, &#x201C;Hours 6-11: Signs of the Hero in Epic and Iconography&#x201D;</a><br><a href="https://www.edx.org/course/harvardx/harvardx-hum2-3x-ancient-greek-hero-24-3916" target="_blank">Module 3, &#x201C;Hours 12-15: Cult of Heroes&#x201D;</a><br><a href="https://www.edx.org/course/harvardx/harvardx-hum2-4x-ancient-greek-hero-24-4011" target="_blank">Module 4, &#x201C;Hours 16-21: The Hero in Tragedy&#x201D;</a><br><a href="https://www.edx.org/course/harvardx/harvardx-hum2-5x-ancient-greek-hero-24-4026" target="_blank">Module 5, &#x201C;Hours 22-24: Plato and Beyond&#x201D;</a></p>\n\n<p>HarvardX pursues the science of learning.

Over four centuries, Harvard University has amassed an astonishing array of tangible things&#x2014;books and manuscripts, art works, scientific specimens, ethnographic artifacts, and historical relics of all sorts. The university not only owns a Gutenberg bible, it also cares for Turkish sun dials, a Chinese crystal ball, a divination basket from Angola, and nineteenth-century &#x201C;spirit writing&#x201D; chalked on a child-sized slate. Tucked away in storage cabinets or hidden in closets and the backrooms of its museums and libraries are Henry David Thoreau&#x2019;s pencil, a life mask of Abraham Lincoln, and chemicals captured from a Confederate ship. The Art Museums not only care for masterpieces of Renaissance painting but for a silver-encrusted cup made from a coconut. The Natural History museums not only preserve dinosaur bones and a fish robot but an intact Mexican tortilla more than a century old.</p>\n\n<p>By learning how and why such things got here, you will discover how material objects have shaped academic disciplines and reinforced or challenged boundaries between people. While this course will not draw on all of these items, it will highlight several to give students a sense of the power of learning through tangible things.</p>\n\n<p>In the first section we will consider how a statue, a fish, and a gingham gown have contributed to Harvard&#x2019;s history, and you will learn the importance of stopping to look at the things around you.</p>\n\n<p>In the next section we will explore some of the ways people have brought things together into purposeful collections to preserve memory, promote commerce, and define culture.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, we will consider ways of rearranging objects to create new ways of thinking about nature, time, and ordinary work.</p>\n\n<p>Along the way you will discover new ways of looking at, organizing, and interpreting tangible things in your own environment.</p>\n\n<p>HarvardX pursues the science of learning.

That past can be directly observed through the study of the human fossil record, the materials preserved for archaeological study, and the DNA of living and extinct human populations. This course will provide an overview of human evolutionary history from the present--contemporary human variation in a comparative context--through our last common ancestor with the living great apes, some 5-7 million years in the past. Emphasis will be placed on major evolutionary changes in the development of humans and the methodological approaches used by paleoanthropologists and related investigators to develop that knowledge. The course will begin by asking basic questions about how evolution operates to shape biological variation and what patterns of variation look like in living humans and apes. We will then look at how the human lineage first began to differentiate from apes, the rise and fall of the Australopithecines, the origin and dispersal of the genus Homo, and eventually the radical evolutionary changes associated with the development of agricultural practices in the past 15,000 years. Throughout the course students will be exposed to the primary data, places and theories that shape our understanding of human evolution.</p>\n\n<p><em>Image: Hands at the Cuevas de las Manos upon R&#xED;o Pinturas, near the town of Perito Moreno in Santa Cruz Province, Argentina.

It is an inclusive, general introductory course, combining natural and cultural geography with history and art. Through the lens of humanism and independent thinking, learners will be encouraged to observe and analyze cultural phenomena from spatial and time perspectives. This course has 12 chapters: The basic research method of world cultural geography; The division of world culture areas; The world&apos;s population distribution and migration of population; Origin of agriculture; Diffusion and regional differences; The origin and spread of the city; Regional differences and characteristics of urban morphology; The spatial distribution of the major languages, religions, ethnicities in the world and their relationship; The great geographical discovery and the formation of the world colonial system; World geopolitics and the spatial structures of the world geography system; Global economic integration; Urbanization and its political, economic, social impacts. Using relevant domestic and foreign textbooks, publications, maps, photos, and charts to show the difference and the changing progress of spatial patterns of the cultures, learners will be asked to observe and analyze cultural phenomena with geographic and spatial vision and to consider the development and changing process of the cultural phenomena in light of time sequence.

  description: '<h4>*Note - This is an Archived course*</h4>\n\n<p>This is a past/archived course. At this time, you can only explore this course in a self-paced fashion. Certain features of this course may not be active, but many people enjoy watching the videos and working with the materials. Make sure to check for reruns of this course.</p>\n\n<hr><p>What is it to be human, and how can ancient concepts of the heroic and anti-heroic inform our understanding of the human condition? That question is at the core of <em>The Ancient Greek Hero</em>, which introduces (or reintroduces) students to the great texts of classical Greek culture by focusing on concepts of the Hero in an engaging, highly comparative way.</p>\n\n<p>The classical Greeks&apos; concepts of Heroes and the &quot;heroic&quot; were very different from the way we understand the term today. In this course, students analyze Greek heroes and anti-heroes in their own historical contexts, in order to gain an understanding of these concepts as they were originally understood while also learning how they can inform our understanding of the human condition in general.</p>\n\n<p>In Greek tradition, a hero was a human, male or female, of the remote past, who was endowed with superhuman abilities by virtue of being descended from an immortal god. Rather than being paragons of virtue, as heroes are viewed in many modern cultures, ancient Greek heroes had all of the qualities and faults of their fellow humans, but on a much larger scale. Further, despite their mortality, heroes, like the gods, were objects of cult worship &#x2013; a dimension which is also explored in depth in the course.</p>\n\n<p>The original sources studied in this course include the Homeric <em>Iliad</em> and <em>Odyssey</em>; tragedies of Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides; songs of Sappho and Pindar; dialogues of Plato; historical texts of Herodotus; and more, including the intriguing but rarely studied dialogue &quot;On Heroes&quot; by Philostratus. All works are presented in English translation, with attention to the subtleties of the original Greek. These original sources are frequently supplemented both by ancient art and by modern comparanda, including opera and cinema (from Jacques Offenbach&apos;s opera <em>Tales of Hoffman</em> to Ridley Scott&apos;s science fiction classic <em>Blade Runner</em>).</p>\n\n<p>The true hero of the course is the logos (&quot;word&quot;) of reasoned expression, as activated by Socratic dialogue. The logos of dialogue requires both careful thought and close (or &quot;slow&quot;) reading, which is a core skill taught in this class. The course begins by considering the heroes of Homer&apos;s epics and ends with Plato&apos;s memories of the final days of Socrates -- memories which can only be fully understood by a reader who has gained a thorough comprehension of the ancient Greek hero in all his or her various manifestations.</p>\n\n<p>Using modern technology and engaging texts, <em>The Ancient Greek Hero </em>provides students who have no previous background in classical Greek civilization with a fully engaging and immediately accessible introduction to the most beautiful moments in this ancient literature, its myths, and its ritual practices.</p>\n\n<p>Before your course starts, try the new edX Demo where you can explore the fun, interactive learning environment and virtual labs. <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/edx/edxdemo101/edx-demo/1038">Learn more</a>.</p>\n\n<p>HarvardX pursues the science of learning.

  description: '<p>In <em>The Unfinished Revolution: Reconstruction and After, 1865-1890</em> Professor Eric Foner examines the pivotal but misunderstood era of Reconstruction that followed the Civil War, the first effort in American history to construct an interracial democracy. Beginning with a discussion of the dramatic change in historians&#x2019; interpretations of the period in the last two generations,&#xA0;Foner&#xA0;goes on to discuss how Reconstruction turned on issues of continued relevance today. Among these are: who is an American citizen and what are citizens&#x2019; rights; what is the relationship between political and economic freedom; which has the primary responsibility for protecting Americans&#x2019; rights &#x2013; the federal or state governments; and how should public authorities respond to episodes of terrorism? The course explores the rewriting of the laws and Constitution to incorporate the principle of equality regardless of race; the accomplishments and failings of Reconstruction governments in the South; the reasons for violent opposition in the South and for the northern retreat from Reconstruction; and the consolidation at the end of the nineteenth century of a new system of white supremacy.&quot;</p>\n\n&#xA0;\n\n<p>Foner&#x2019;s new book <em><a href="http://books.wwnorton.com/books/Gateway-to-Freedom/" target="_blank">Gateway to Freedom: The Hidden History of the Underground Railroad</a>&#xA0;</em>is available wherever books are sold.</p>\n\n<p><strong>See other courses in this series:</strong><br><a href="https://www.edx.org/course/columbiax/columbiax-hist1-1x-civil-war-2241" target="_blank">The Civil War and Reconstruction - 1850-1861</a><br><a href="https://www.edx.org/course/columbiax/columbiax-hist1-2x-civil-war-2666" target="_blank">The Civil War and Reconstruction - 1861-1865</a></p>',

Between the Assad regime and ISIS, civilians in Syria and Iraq face unimaginable atrocities. Should the U.S. intervene? China&#x2019;s rise is rattling capitalist economies and a half-century of Pacific peace. What counterbalancing actions should Washington take?

We will go behind the veil to see the dynamic between the press and the U.S. government, to explore these dilemmas.

How did students themselves, who represented the vast accumulation of knowledge in Tokyo, perform in front of these gazes?

Since that time, U.S. troops, covert operatives and proxies have engaged in costly exertions in predominantly Muslim societies everywhere from the Levant and the Persian Gulf to East Africa and Central Asia. With what result? Washington&apos;s efforts have exacted a terrible toll, squandering vast amounts of blood and treasure.

America&#x2019;s War for the Greater Middle East has failed, and that failure is irreversible.</p>\n\n<p>This course offers a history of that war. It identifies the factors that inspired the United States to launch the conflict and to persist in a doomed enterprise. It describes how the war unfolded from one phase to the next, from the era of Jimmy Carter to the age of Barack Obama. It catalogs errors of judgment and implementation made along the way. It invites students to consider alternative approaches to policy that might have better served the interests of the United States and of the people living in countries invaded, occupied, bombed and otherwise subjected to American punishment.</p>',

We will examine the impact of key events such as Bleeding Kansas, the Dred Scott decision, the Lincoln-Douglas debates, and John Brown&#x2019;s raid on Harper&#x2019;s Ferry, and end with the dissolution of the Union in the winter of 1860-61.<br><br>\nThis course is part of the series, <em>Civil War and Reconstruction</em>, which introduces students to the most pivotal era in American history.&#xA0; The Civil War transformed the nation by eliminating the threat of secession and destroying the institution of slavery.&#xA0; It raised questions that remain central to our understanding of ourselves as a people and a nation &#x2014; the balance of power between local and national authority, the boundaries of citizenship, and the meanings of freedom and equality.&#xA0; The series will examine the causes of the war, the road to secession, the conduct of the Civil War, the coming of emancipation, and the struggle after the war to breathe meaning into the promise of freedom for four million emancipated slaves.&#xA0; One theme throughout the series is what might be called the politics of history &#x2014; how the world in which a historian lives affects his or her view of the past, and how historical interpretations reinforce or challenge the social order of the present.</p>\n\n<p><strong>See other courses in this series:</strong><br><a href="https://www.edx.org/course/columbiax/columbiax-hist1-2x-civil-war-2666" target="_blank">The Civil War and Reconstruction - 1861-1865</a><br><a href="http://www.edx.org/course/columbiax/columbiax-hist1-3x-civil-war-3146" target="_blank">The Civil War and Reconstruction - 1865-1890</a></p>\n\n<hr><p>Image courtesy of Library of Congress<br>\n&#xA0;</p>',

Video lectures will be in Korean, with English subtitles. Discussions, quizzes, and other course content will be in English. This course is the first part of International Politics in the Korean Peninsula; the second part will start this Fall.</p>\n\n<p>The course is introduced with two cases where politics brought tragedies: the hyper-inflation in Zimbabwe and the political idolization in North Korea. These two cases provide a good answer to why we study politics.</p>\n\n<p>The central content of the course is organized into two modules. First, it will start with several chapters from Records of the Grand Historian (Chinese: &#x53F2;&#x8A18;), Plutarch&apos;s Lives, and History of the Three Kingdoms (&#xD55C;&#xAD6D;&#xC5B4;: &#xC0BC;&#xAD6D;&#xC0AC;&#xAE30;; Chinese: &#x4E09;&#x570B;&#x53F2;&#x8A18;) to find out four archetypes of politics: value creation/distribution in a political entity, conflict and cooperation among political entities, development and maintenance of an identity in a political entity, and leadership selection in an entity.</p>\n\n<p>The second module of the course will link the four archetypes of politics with contemporary issues of inter-Korean politics and political events in North Korea. These issues will include the Korean Crisis in 2012, the arms race between the two Koreas, the power succession and the simultaneous (nuclear and economic) build-up strategy in North Korea, and upcoming political events.</p>\n\n<p>The main course image is copyright &#xA9; 2013 Seoul National University News.</p>',

JuryX: Deliberations for Social Change is an invitation to explore the concept of jury in both in theory and in practice, exploring both the political theory and history of the jury as well as techniques for engaging in juristic discussion.</p>\n<p>The course consists of six modules. In each module, you will begin by engaging with a case on your own, much like a jury views evidence, before engaging in small group discussions with your peers about the topic at hand. The course begins with historical legal cases and then moves to major contemporary issues. These include: decriminalization of marijuana in Jamaica and worldwide efforts to legalize, the potential for the Olympics and World Cup to advance education, individual identity and anonymity surrounding the NSA leak by Edward Snowden, and lethal police action against young black men, crystallized in the hashtag #icantbreathe.</p>\n<p>Deliberations will be real and virtual, synchronous and asynchronous. &#x2028;Cases will be hosted on the edX platform, but deliberation groups will meet in a variety of media best suited to each group. The supported deliberation environment for online synchronous deliberation will be &#x2018;Unhangout,&#x2019; a video-based discussion tool developed at the MIT Media Lab.

By the end of this course, students will be able to better understand the field of genomics; be familiar with various online databases and resources; and understand and appreciate the medical, social, ethical, and legal issues associated with the availability of personal genomic information.</p>\n\n<p>Given the diversity of the topics and the specific expertise required to cover each, this is a unique cross-disciplinary course where faculty from different disciplines including genetics, computational sciences, bioinformatics, genetic counseling, bioethics, law, and business will participate in lecturing. We have assembled a team of experts from various departments at Georgetown University and other institutions, to teach this comprehensive online genomics course.</p>\n\n<p>For a detailed description of the weekly topics, see the <a href="https://edge.edx.org/c4x/GeorgetownX/MEDX-202-01/asset/Genomics_Course_Outline_5222014.pdf">course outline</a>.</p>',

What happens when one party does not hold to their part of the deal?<br><br>\nWe are exposed to contracts in all areas of our life&#x2014; agreeing to terms when downloading a new computer program, hiring a contractor to repair a leaking roof, and even ordering a meal at a restaurant. Knowing the principles of contracts is not just a skill needed by lawyers, it illuminates for everyone a crucial institution that we use all the time and generally take for granted.<br><br>\nThis course is designed to introduce the range of issues that arise when entering and enforcing contracts. It will provide an introduction to what a contract is and also analyze the purpose and significance of contracts. Then, it will discuss the intent to create legal relations, legality and morality, and the distinction between gifts and bargains. The course also investigates common pitfalls: one-sided promises, mistake, fraud, and frustration. With the knowledge of what makes contracts and how they can go wrong, Professor Fried will discuss remedies and specific performance. Finally, Professor Fried will introduce how contracts can create rights for third parties.&#xA0;<br><br>\nThe course&#x2019;s instructor, Charles Fried, has been teaching at Harvard Law School for more than 50 years and has written extensively on contracts. Not only is Professor Fried a leading authority on contract law, but he also utilizes a story-telling approach to explaining the topic, which creates a unique and interesting class experience.</p>\n\n<p>HarvardX pursues the science of learning.

After a brief history of the U.S. prison system, early prisoner writing, and a survey of prisoner writing from 1904 to 1970, we will explore—through prisoner witness—the issues raised by the unprecedented rise of the nation’s mass-incarceration regime since the early 1970s.',

American ex-offenders are arrested again at a rate of 67% within three years, and 75% within five years of release. This course looks inside U.S. prisons, through the history of literary witness produced by incarcerated people. This history will help us to understand the mass-scale prison&#x2019;s rise, its day-to-day practices, and why it fails so badly at the task of rehabilitation. Through prison witness, we may hope to begin to understand what is needed to make the U.S. prison a more socially constructive institution. Among other texts, we will read and discuss Fourth City: Essays from the Prison in America, The (online) American Prison Writing Archive, hosted and made possible by Hamilton College&apos;s Digital Humanities Initiative, and come to a sense of the moral weight that prison witness must carry in any truly democratic debate on the criminal justice system.</span></p>',

Since then, the technique has evolved tremendously, giving hope and increased quality of life to many patients around the world. While the technology and drugs advance, several controversies persist regarding the way in which organs may be obtained. Some of these dilemmas arose on the very first day in which organs&#x2019; transplantation originated; others have emerged as a result of new phenomena such as transplantation tourism, the new possibilities brought by donation after cardio-circulatory death, or increasing knowledge about the remaining physiological functions detected in patients pronounced as brain dead. Almost all countries in the world forbid the selling of organs. Why? Although many people die while on the waiting lists, in no country does the Government confiscate cadaveric organs. Why? May minors be organ donors? Should we abandon the so-called &#x201C;dead donor rule&#x201D; and allow &#x201C;organ-donation euthanasia&#x201D;? How does the potential condition of becoming a donor influence the administration of end-of-life care? How should we avoid the eventual conflict of interests between those who care for the life of future recipients of organs and those who are in charge of the dying patient-eventual-donor? In this course we will explore the answers to these questions, and we will also engage in the assessment of the more recent challenges posed by novel transplantation techniques, and, albeit briefly, in the discussion regarding the fair distribution of organs.&#xA0;</em></p>',

Since then, the technique has evolved tremendously, giving hope and increased quality of life to many patients around the world. While the technology and drugs advance, several controversies persist regarding the way in which organs may be obtained. Some of these dilemmas arose on the very first day in which organs&#x2019; transplantation originated; others have emerged as a result of new phenomena such as transplantation tourism, the new possibilities brought by donation after cardio-circulatory death, or increasing knowledge about the remaining physiological functions detected in patients pronounced as brain dead. Almost all countries in the world forbid the selling of organs. Why? Although many people die while on the waiting lists, in no country does the Government confiscate cadaveric organs. Why? May minors be organ donors? Should we abandon the so-called &#x201C;dead donor rule&#x201D; and allow &#x201C;organ-donation euthanasia&#x201D;? How does the potential condition of becoming a donor influence the administration of end-of-life care?

  description: '<p>For the first hundreds of years of modern medicine, progress was a process of trial and error, and to be honest, it was often fatal error, such as bloodletting, which killed the first US president George Washington. Where diseases were clearly understood, and where treatments obviously worked on most patients, such as penicillin for pneumonia, there was no need to delve deeper into questions of effectiveness. But for most conditions, the treatment benefits were modest and there was a need for improved ways of telling whether a new intervention was better than the previous standard treatment. And so scientists introduced a testing procedure for new treatments - the randomized controlled trial.</p>\n\n<p>As the cost of developing new treatments grew, it became very important to detect the slightest improvement that could be attributed to the new drug in order to get it licensed and marketed. So the usual randomized trial was answering the following question: does this treatment work (for otherwise well people with just this single disease, with perfect adherence, treated by the best doctors, under idealised conditions)? But most patients have multiple diseases, imperfect adherence, ordinary doctors and non-ideal circumstances. These patients want to know whether a new treatment is likely to reduce important harms for ordinary people like them, receiving usual care. This mismatch meant that most trials were overestimating the real world effectiveness of new interventions.</p>\n\n<p>In this MOOC, we are going to study this mismatch, and see what its effect is on modern medical care. One example of the studies we will discuss is the VIGOR trial. This influential drug trial resulted in the widespread global overuse of this drug, at a cost of wasted billions of dollars. Ironically, this drug, intended to reduce a problem in individuals, ended up causing more of the same problem in the population!</p>\n\n<p>After we understand the consequences of designing the wrong kinds of trials, we will also look at how best to design pragmatic randomized trials, which answer the important questions that ordinary patients and decision makers in the real world most often ask. We will also explore how these can be combined with economic evaluations and qualitative research &#x2013; to answer important questions about how much these interventions cost, and how they are experienced by the recipients.</p>',

This course will address this need by covering the principles of biostatistics and epidemiology used for public health and clinical research. These include outcomes measurement, measures of associations between outcomes and their determinants, study design options, bias and confounding, probability and diagnostic tests, confidence intervals and hypothesis testing, power and sample size determinations, life tables and survival methods, regression methods (both, linear and logistic), and sample survey techniques. Students will analyze sample data sets to acquire knowledge of appropriate computer software.

The fifth and final module in <em>The Ancient Greek Hero in 24 Hours</em>, &#x201C;Hours 22-24: Plato and Beyond&#x201D; challenges the idea that Socrates was a hero, just as Plato&#x2019;s&#xA0;Socrates himself challenges&#xA0;that same idea. And yet, as we will see from reading Plato&#x2019;s&#xA0;Apology of&#xA0;Socrates&#xA0;and&#xA0;Phaedo, the idea of the hero is very&#xA0;much present in Plato&#x2019;s works &#x2013; just as it persists in&#xA0;works beyond Plato,&#xA0;whether or not these works adopt Plato&#x2019;s project of trying to substitute&#xA0;philosophy for&#xA0;literature (especially for poetry). Just as poetry serves as a&#xA0;primary representative for the idea of the hero,&#xA0;we will discover though our&#xA0;close readings that the philosophical prose of Plato likewise represents this&#xA0;same idea - though now the hero is no longer some superhuman human. Rather, the&#xA0;real hero now&#xA0;becomes the word of philosophical dialogue, which is brought back&#xA0;to life much as a cult hero is brought&#xA0;back to life ever time a heroic life is&#xA0;narrated or dramatized. In Plato&#x2019;s works, the narration and the&#xA0;dramatization&#xA0;show not the life of the hero but the life of the word that survives the&#xA0;speaker of the word,&#xA0;provided that the word engages in dialogue &#x2013; a&#xA0;philosophical dialogue that contemplates the eternal truths&#xA0;of the cosmos.&#xA0;<br>\n&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;<br><strong>See other courses in this series:</strong><br><a href="https://www.edx.org/course/harvardx/harvardx-hum2-1x-ancient-greek-hero-24-3131">Module 1, &#x201C;Hours 1-5: Epic and Lyric&#x201D;</a><br><a href="https://www.edx.org/course/harvardx/harvardx-hum2-2x-ancient-greek-hero-24-3431">Module 2, &#x201C;Hours 6-11: Signs of the Hero in Epic and Iconography&#x201D;</a><br><a href="https://www.edx.org/course/harvardx/harvardx-hum2-3x-ancient-greek-hero-24-3916" target="_blank">Module 3, &#x201C;Hours 12-15: Cult of Heroes&#x201D;</a><br><a href="https://www.edx.org/course/harvardx/harvardx-hum2-4x-ancient-greek-hero-24-4011" target="_blank">Module 4, &#x201C;Hours 16-21: The Hero in Tragedy&#x201D;</a></p>\n\n<p>HarvardX pursues the science of learning.

After a brief history of the U.S. prison system, early prisoner writing, and a survey of prisoner writing from 1904 to 1970, we will explore—through prisoner witness—the issues raised by the unprecedented rise of the nation’s mass-incarceration regime since the early 1970s.',
  description: '<p><span>The U.S. incarcerates a larger number and percentage of its own citizens than any nation on earth: larger than China, Russia, Cuba, or Iran. American ex-offenders are arrested again at a rate of 67% within three years, and 75% within five years of release. This course looks inside U.S. prisons, through the history of literary witness produced by incarcerated people. This history will help us to understand the mass-scale prison&#x2019;s rise, its day-to-day practices, and why it fails so badly at the task of rehabilitation. Through prison witness, we may hope to begin to understand what is needed to make the U.S. prison a more socially constructive institution. Among other texts, we will read and discuss Fourth City: Essays from the Prison in America, The (online) American Prison Writing Archive, hosted and made possible by Hamilton College&apos;s Digital Humanities Initiative, and come to a sense of the moral weight that prison witness must carry in any truly democratic debate on the criminal justice system.</span></p>',

The fourth of five modules in <em>The Ancient Greek Hero in 24 Hours</em>, &#x201C;Hours 16-21: The Hero in Tragedy&#x201D; finds us in the world of high classical poetry in drama,&#xA0;as brought to life&#xA0;in three tragedies of Aeschylus, two of Sophocles, and two of Euripides. We see&#xA0;here&#xA0;the Greek hero as best known to us from the perspective of world&#xA0;literature. The medium of drama makes&#xA0;heroes seem more familiar to us, since we&#xA0;think we know drama better than we know other verbal arts&#xA0;such as epic and&#xA0;lyric, but, by the time we finish analyzing the seven classical tragedies that&#xA0;we will be&#xA0;reading, we will see that the traditions of hero cult, infused into&#xA0;the verbal art of drama, cast an altogether&#xA0;new light on tragedy, defamiliarizing&#xA0;for us not only the heroes illuminated by this art but also the art itself.&#xA0;We&#xA0;will see, then, maybe for the first time ever, that the ancient Greek hero of&#xA0;tragedy was not at all like&#xA0;us &#x2013; even less like us than the hero of epic or&#xA0;lyric. The male and female heroes of drama were larger than&#xA0;life, far more so&#xA0;than we may ever have imagined, reaching levels of both nobility and debasement&#xA0;that&#xA0;challenge our sense of equilibrium in the cosmos. As our close readings of&#xA0;our seven chosen tragedies&#xA0;will show, there was a disequilibrium in myths about&#xA0;heroes in the remote past, and this disequilibrium&#xA0;could be compensated only by&#xA0;experiencing the equilibrium of rituals in the immediate present &#x2013; rituals&#xA0;culminating in the drama of heroic tragedy.<br>\n&#xA0;<br><strong>See other courses in this series:</strong><br><a href="https://www.edx.org/course/harvardx/harvardx-hum2-1x-ancient-greek-hero-24-3131">Module 1, &#x201C;Hours 1-5: Epic and Lyric&#x201D;</a><br><a href="https://www.edx.org/course/harvardx/harvardx-hum2-2x-ancient-greek-hero-24-3431">Module 2, &#x201C;Hours 6-11: Signs of the Hero in Epic and Iconography&#x201D;</a><br><a href="https://www.edx.org/course/harvardx/harvardx-hum2-3x-ancient-greek-hero-24-3916" target="_blank">Module 3, &#x201C;Hours 12-15: Cult of Heroes&#x201D;</a><br><a href="https://www.edx.org/course/harvardx/harvardx-hum2-5x-ancient-greek-hero-24-4026" target="_blank">Module 5, &#x201C;Hours 22-24: Plato and Beyond&#x201D;</a><br><br>\nHarvardX pursues the science of learning.

The third of five modules in <em>The Ancient Greek Hero in 24 Hours</em>, &#x201C;Hours 12-15: Cult of Heroes&#x201D; explores the vast variety of perspectives brought to bear on&#xA0;the idea of the&#xA0;ancient Greek hero in the versatile medium of prose, as exemplified by authors&#xA0;as varied&#xA0;as Herodotus, the so-called father of history, and Philostratus, an&#xA0;intellectual from a post-classical period&#xA0;who was prodigiously well-versed in classical&#xA0;and pre-classical lore about cult heroes.</p>\n\n<p>In&#xA0;Homeric poetry the idea of hero cult is implicit even though&#xA0;characters like Odysseus are not&#xA0;explicitly identified as cult heroes. The&#xA0;situation is different, however, in the poetry attributed to Hesiod,&#xA0;where the&#xA0;very idea of a cult hero is precisely outlined and illustrated, especially in&#xA0;the myth about the five&#xA0;generations of humankind. As we will see from&#xA0;the lively prose&#xA0;narratives of such learned and captivating authors as Herodotus and Philostratus, the mystique of cult heroes,&#xA0;both male&#xA0;and female, enthralled their adoring worshippers, who treasured the exotic&#xA0;stories of epiphanies and&#xA0;miracles that were linked with the places made sacred&#xA0;by the felt presence of heroes residing in the&#xA0;mother earth that concealed&#xA0;their bodies. We will even get the chance to read and analyze an&#xA0;eyewitness prose account of an actual initiation into the mysteries of a hero cult.&#xA0;This prose account&#xA0;brings home to us the seriousness of personally experiencing&#xA0;such an initiation, and it shows the&#xA0;emotional impact of making contact with&#xA0;the consciousness of superhuman forces that inhabit the&#xA0;mystical world of hero&#xA0;cult.</p>\n\n<p><strong>See other courses in this series:</strong><br>\n<a href="https://www.edx.org/course/harvardx/harvardx-hum2-1x-ancient-greek-hero-24-3131" target="_blank">Module 1, &#x201C;Hours 1-5: Epic and Lyric&#x201D;</a><br>\n<a href="https://www.edx.org/course/harvardx/harvardx-hum2-2x-ancient-greek-hero-24-3431" target="_blank">Module 2, &#x201C;Hours 6-11: Signs of the Hero in Epic and Iconography&#x201D;</a><br>\n<a href="https://www.edx.org/course/harvardx/harvardx-hum2-4x-ancient-greek-hero-24-4011" target="_blank">Module 4, &#x201C;Hours 16-21: The Hero in Tragedy&#x201D;</a><br>\n<a href="https://www.edx.org/course/harvardx/harvardx-hum2-5x-ancient-greek-hero-24-4026" target="_blank">Module 5, &#x201C;Hours 22-24: Plato and Beyond&#x201D;</a></p>\n<p>HarvardX pursues the science of learning.

We believe that scientists and cultural critics can learn valuable lessons from one another, even as they create their own responses to HIV/AIDS. Today, over 30 years since the first scientific reports of HIV/AIDS, the pandemic remains a major health concern throughout the world. But, rays of hope have led to speculation that an AIDS-free generation may be possible.

Shakespeare is also rightly regarded as one of the greatest playwrights the world has known. This course will try to understand both Shakespeare&#x2019;s popularity and his greatness by starting from a simple premise: that the fullest appreciation of Shakespeare can be achieved only when literary study is combined with analysis of the plays as theatre. Hence, as we delve into the dimensions that make Shakespeare&#x2019;s plays so extraordinary--from the astonishing power of their language to their uncanny capacity to illuminate so much of human life--we will also explore them in performance from Shakespeare&#x2019;s own theatre to the modern screen. At the same time, actors will occasionally join our effort and demonstrate ways of bringing the text alive as living theatre. Plays to be studied will include <em>Romeo and Juliet, A Midsummer Night&apos;s Dream, Much Ado About Nothing, Othello, King Lear</em>, and <em>The Winter&apos;s Tale</em>.</p>\n\n<p><em>Image courtesy Castle Rock Entertainment/The Kobal Collection</em></p>\n\n<p>Before your course starts, try the new edX Demo where you can explore the fun, interactive learning environment and virtual labs. <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/edx/edxdemo101/edx-demo/1038">Learn more</a>.</p>',

The second of five modules in <em>The Ancient Greek Hero in 24 Hours</em>, &#x201C;Hours 6-11: Signs of the Hero in Epic and Iconography&#x201D; explores the interactions of text and image in a culture where the &#x201C;text&#x201D; is not a written document but a live performance and where the &#x201C;image&#x201D; is not based on anything that is written down but exists as a free-standing medium of the visual arts, expressing the same myths that are being systematically expressed by the medium of Homeric poetry. Almost all of the images we will be studying are samples of a form of vase painting known as the &#x201C;Black Figure&#x201D; technique. We will practice how to &#x201C;read&#x201D; such a medium, analyzing what it tells us about ancient Greek heroes like Achilles, in conjunction with our &#x201C;reading&#x201D; the performance tradition of the Homeric Iliad itself.</p>\n\n<p>It is important to keep in mind, as we read these images and texts together, that the myths expressed by these media were meant to be taken very seriously. In the ancient Greek song culture, myth was not mere fiction. Just the opposite: myth was a formulation of eternal cosmic truths! So, the myths conveyed by the images of the paintings we will study are just as &#x201C;truthful,&#x201D; from the standpoint of ancient Greek song culture, as are the related myths conveyed by the Homeric Iliad. We need to read both the texts and the images of these myths as an accurate formulation of an integral system of thought the expresses most clearly and authoritatively all those things that really matter in life.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, this module foregrounds the historical fact, explored more fully in the third module (&#x201C;Hours 12-15: The Cult of Heroes&#x201D;), that the heroes who were characters in the myths of ancient Greek epic, lyric, and other verbal media were at the same time worshipped as superhuman forces by the communities where their bodies were thought to be hidden from outsiders. When we take for example the Homeric <em>Odyssey</em>, we find that the main hero of this epic, Odysseus, was a cult hero, not only an epic hero. And the agenda that center on the idea of a cult hero, like the prospect of immortalization after death, can be clearly seen in the overall plot of the <em>Odyssey</em>, especially in the memorable scene where the hero experiences his homecoming to Ithaca at the same moment when the sun rises as he wakes from a mystical overnight sleep while sailing homeward.</p>\n\n<p><strong>See other courses in this series:</strong><br>\n<a href="https://www.edx.org/course/harvardx/harvardx-hum2-1x-ancient-greek-hero-24-3131" target="_blank">Module 1, &#x201C;Hours 1-5: Epic and Lyric&#x201D;</a><br>\n<a href="https://www.edx.org/course/harvardx/harvardx-hum2-3x-ancient-greek-hero-24-3916" target="_blank">Module 3, &#x201C;Hours 12-15: Cult of Heroes&#x201D;</a><br>\n<a href="https://www.edx.org/course/harvardx/harvardx-hum2-4x-ancient-greek-hero-24-4011" target="_blank">Module 4, &#x201C;Hours 16-21: The Hero in Tragedy&#x201D;</a><br>\n<a href="https://www.edx.org/course/harvardx/harvardx-hum2-5x-ancient-greek-hero-24-4026" target="_blank">Module 5, &#x201C;Hours 22-24: Plato and Beyond&#x201D;</a></p>\n<p>HarvardX pursues the science of learning.

That is a central idea of &#x201C;The Art of Poetry,&#x201D; well demonstrated by the videos at favoritepoem.org: the photographer saying Sylvia Plath&#x2019;s &#x201C;Nick and the Candlestick,&#x201D; the high school student saying Langston Hughes&#x2019; &#x201C;Minstrel Man.&#x201D; Those readers base what they say about each poem upon their experience of saying it.</p>\n\n<p>The course is demanding, and based on a certain kind of intense, exigent reading, requiring prolonged&#x2014; in fact, repeated&#x2014; attention to specific poems.</p>\n\n<p>The readings will include historical poems, as well as contemporary work. The focus will be on elements of the art such as poetry&#x2019;s historical relation to courtship; techniques of sound in free verse; poetry&#x2019;s relation to music; the nature of greatness&#x2014;with only incidental attention to schools of poetry, categories and trends.</p>\n\n<p>Students are encouraged to think truly, carefully and passionately about what the poem says, along with how the poem feels in one&#x2019;s own, actual or imagined voice. As Robert Pinsky says, in the Preface to <em>Singing School</em>: &#x201C;this anthology will succeed if it encourages the reader to emulate it by replacing it . . . create your own anthology.&#x201D; In a comparable way, this course hopes to inspire a lifelong study of poetry.</p>',

Make sure to check for reruns of this course.</p>\n\n<hr><p>What is it to be human, and how can ancient concepts of the heroic and anti-heroic inform our understanding of the human condition? That question is at the core of <em>The Ancient Greek Hero</em>, which introduces (or reintroduces) students to the great texts of classical Greek culture by focusing on concepts of the Hero in an engaging, highly comparative way.</p>\n\n<p>The classical Greeks&apos; concepts of Heroes and the &quot;heroic&quot; were very different from the way we understand the term today. In this course, students analyze Greek heroes and anti-heroes in their own historical contexts, in order to gain an understanding of these concepts as they were originally understood while also learning how they can inform our understanding of the human condition in general.</p>\n\n<p>In Greek tradition, a hero was a human, male or female, of the remote past, who was endowed with superhuman abilities by virtue of being descended from an immortal god. Rather than being paragons of virtue, as heroes are viewed in many modern cultures, ancient Greek heroes had all of the qualities and faults of their fellow humans, but on a much larger scale. Further, despite their mortality, heroes, like the gods, were objects of cult worship &#x2013; a dimension which is also explored in depth in the course.</p>\n\n<p>The original sources studied in this course include the Homeric <em>Iliad</em> and <em>Odyssey</em>; tragedies of Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides; songs of Sappho and Pindar; dialogues of Plato; historical texts of Herodotus; and more, including the intriguing but rarely studied dialogue &quot;On Heroes&quot; by Philostratus. All works are presented in English translation, with attention to the subtleties of the original Greek. These original sources are frequently supplemented both by ancient art and by modern comparanda, including opera and cinema (from Jacques Offenbach&apos;s opera <em>Tales of Hoffman</em> to Ridley Scott&apos;s science fiction classic <em>Blade Runner</em>).</p>\n\n<p>The true hero of the course is the logos (&quot;word&quot;) of reasoned expression, as activated by Socratic dialogue. The logos of dialogue requires both careful thought and close (or &quot;slow&quot;) reading, which is a core skill taught in this class. The course begins by considering the heroes of Homer&apos;s epics and ends with Plato&apos;s memories of the final days of Socrates -- memories which can only be fully understood by a reader who has gained a thorough comprehension of the ancient Greek hero in all his or her various manifestations.</p>\n\n<p>Using modern technology and engaging texts, <em>The Ancient Greek Hero </em>provides students who have no previous background in classical Greek civilization with a fully engaging and immediately accessible introduction to the most beautiful moments in this ancient literature, its myths, and its ritual practices.</p>\n\n<p>Before your course starts, try the new edX Demo where you can explore the fun, interactive learning environment and virtual labs. <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/edx/edxdemo101/edx-demo/1038">Learn more</a>.</p>\n\n<p>HarvardX pursues the science of learning.

The first of five modules on The Ancient Greek Hero, &#x201C;Epic and Lyric&#x201D; looks at ancient Greek heroes from the perspective of two different but related media of poetry and songmaking, <em>epic</em> and <em>lyric</em>. The major focus is Achilles, especially as viewed through the lens of the Homeric <em>Iliad</em> <u>and</u> through the &#x201C;rose-colored glasses&#x201D; of Sappho&#x2019;s songs. While the epic of the <em>Iliad</em> is typical of verbal art that is performed by and for men, the lyric songs of Sappho derive from traditions of singing performed mainly by women of all ages, including adolescents about to be initiated into womanhood. These &#x201C;women&#x2019;s traditions&#x201D; are best known for two kinds of singing, laments and love songs, which are interchangeable in contexts that will surprise the modern mind. Another surprise, as we will see, is that the <em>Iliad</em> too contains embedded &#x201C;quotations&#x201D; of such laments and love songs, and that our first impression of this epic as a &#x201C;men&#x2019;s tradition&#x201D; obscures the fact that Homeric poetry channels the songs of women as well as men. A perfect expression of such &#x201C;channeling&#x201D; is the figure of Achilles himself, who was admired by Greek song culture as a virtuoso singer of laments and love songs in his own right. An analysis of Homeric passages that &#x201C;quote&#x201D; the singing of Achilles will be an integral part of our overall experience in close reading.</p>\n\n<p><strong>See other courses in this series:</strong><br><a href="https://www.edx.org/course/harvardx/harvardx-hum2-2x-ancient-greek-hero-24-3431" target="_blank">Module 2, &#x201C;Hours 6-11: Signs of the Hero in Epic and Iconography&#x201D;</a><br><a href="https://www.edx.org/course/harvardx/harvardx-hum2-3x-ancient-greek-hero-24-3916" target="_blank">Module 3, &#x201C;Hours 12-15: Cult of Heroes&#x201D;</a><br><a href="https://www.edx.org/course/harvardx/harvardx-hum2-4x-ancient-greek-hero-24-4011" target="_blank">Module 4, &#x201C;Hours 16-21: The Hero in Tragedy&#x201D;</a><br><a href="https://www.edx.org/course/harvardx/harvardx-hum2-5x-ancient-greek-hero-24-4026" target="_blank">Module 5, &#x201C;Hours 22-24: Plato and Beyond&#x201D;</a></p>\n\n<p>HarvardX pursues the science of learning.

Philosophers, scientists, artists, and poets overthrew our understanding of the physical world, of human behavior, of thought and its limits, and of art, creativity, and beauty.

  description: '<h4><em>Turn back if you would see your shores again.</em><br><em>Do not set forth upon the deep,</em><br><em>for, losing sight of me, you would be lost.</em><br><em>-Paradiso</em>, Canto II, lines 4-6</h4>\n\n<p>Joy is the business of Paradiso, that much is clear; but could there be a more mysterious word in the whole realm of human imagination than &#x201C;Joy?&#x201D; &#x201C;Joy&#x201D; boggles the human imagination because it asks us to follow the vector of hope to its maximal extension and intention, until it arrives at that point which Dante locates &#x201C;nel mezzo,&#x201D; at the very center of everything, at that point where every centripetal and centrifugal force of both the physical universe of energy and the symbolic universe of creative imagination and meaning first arise and finally return.</p>\n\n<p>From beginning to end, the Pilgrim&#x2019;s progress through Paradiso is enabled and guided by his enactment of the role to which he consented in the climactic episode of the Purgatorio in the garden of the Earthly Paradise. Now leaving Earth behind and beneath, the Pilgrim is transformed into the disciple; specifically, the disciple of Beatrice. She now becomes his true path, <em>la diritta via</em>, along which he gradually discovers the Joy that Christianity identifies as the hope of Resurrection.</p>\n\n<p>Dante&#x2019;s<em> Paradiso</em> maps the physics of freedom, tracing a universal history of meaning. Just as there is a physics of matter and energy, there is a physics of freedom governing the evolutionary history of hope which directs the human search for meaning in every person&#x2019;s life and in all human culture. In this universe, meaning functions as does light in the physical universe, acting as its absolute measure and enforcing its most basic law&#x2014;the law of relational identity, where &#x201C;all are responsible to all for all.&#x201D; Like the principle of relativity in the physics of energy, relational identity means that each personal existence has historical reality only in relation to all other personal identities.</p>\n\n<p>Almost everyone agrees that the poetry of the<em> Paradiso</em> is sublime. Sublimity, however, is a highly rarefied and strenuously acquired taste. This is why Dante himself warns us in the second canto of the<em> Paradiso </em>that unless we have become used to eat the &#x201C;bread of Angels,&#x201D; we should turn back and not attempt to follow him on this final leg of his journey, and we as modern-day readers might well be tempted here to turn back as the Pilgrim himself was tempted in the second canto of the <em>Inferno</em>. But to paraphrase Virgil&#x2019;s response then, which both encouraged and challenged, &#x201C;Why be so afraid to reach for what your heart most hopes for; where else do you have to turn?&#x201D;</p>\n\n<p><span>In this course, you will be asked to participate in learning&#xA0;</span><span>activities on both edX and on MyDante, an innovative platform for deep&#xA0;</span><span>reading that emphasizes mindfulness and contemplative reading habits</span><br><span>as key to deriving lasting meaning from poetic texts.

Indeed, there is work aplenty on Mount Purgatorio, but there is also so much more. There is day and night, labor and rest, waking and dreaming, all the rhythms of diurnal living; but above all, there is the delight of hope. All that the penitent souls suffer here, they undergo in the eagerness of passionate yearning to be healed of the wounds of sin inflicted on them as part of the universal heritage of humanity. Purgatory is a &#x201C;school of contemplation,&#x201D; where the healing of wounds coincides with learning to suffer the weight of responsibility for one&#x2019;s own identity as a person. For those willing to undertake the steep ascent of Dante&#x2019;s seven-story Mountain, nowhere in the legacy of human culture is the process of becoming a &#x201C;whole person&#x201D; more closely observed or rendered with deeper psychological and social insight than in the cantos of Dante&#x2019;s <em>Purgatorio.</em></p>\n\n<p>For us as modern readers, Mount Purgatorio is a steep ascent indeed, and if fewer of us accept this challenging invitation than do for the careen through Hell, then it should come as no surprise for us to learn of the untold years, centuries perhaps, that the souls whom Dante meets there require to complete their climb. A realistic willingness to suffer consciously and voluntarily, motivated by authentic hope, is hardly recognized as a possibility by most of us today for whom security and prosperity are accepted as the unqualified goals of our striving. Even to consider an alternative of the sort which Dante offers us in the <em>Purgatorio </em>is already a notable achievement, but one which the imaginative power of Dante&#x2019;s poetry here places within our reach.

We will look at some perennial philosophical problems: Is there a God? What is knowledge, and how do we get it? What is the place of our consciousness in the physical world? Do we have free will? How do we persist over time, as our bodily and psychological traits change? The second goal is to get you thinking philosophically yourself. This will help you develop your critical reasoning and argumentative skills more generally. Along the way we will draw from late, great classical authors and influential contemporary figures.</p>\n\n<p>If you wish to take the course as a &apos;verified&apos; student (technological checks guarantee it is you taking the course) then please register as Verified below. It will cost you $50. Upon completing the course you will receive a certificate that says that you completed the course as a &apos;verified&apos; student. Otherwise you can take the course as a non-verified student (you guarantee it is you taking the course by signing an honor code) for free. You will receive a certificate that says that you completed the course as a non-verified student.<br><br>\nNext Spring (2015) we will be offering 24.118x Paradox and Infinity for the first time.

It explores vernacular architecture as an expression of local identity, indigenous traditions, and assimilation of different cultures.</p>\n\n<p>This course covers topics such as native building materials, the interaction between people, culture and the vernacular, as well as the vernacular landscape. It has a special emphasis on the built heritage of Asia, which allows students to take a closer look at examples in diverse locales, such as the leather yurts in Mongolia, timber houses in Japan, brick, mud and straw houses in India, reinforced concrete fortified towers and grey brick courtyard houses in Southern China including Macau and Hong Kong.</p>\n\n<p>Designed to promote discussion and dialogue while contributing to the discourse surrounding the concept of the vernacular, this course challenges the perception of tradition and stimulates a deeper analysis of one&#x2019;s local environment.

  description: '<h4><em>Turn back if you would see your shores again.</em><br><em>Do not set forth upon the deep,</em><br><em>for, losing sight of me, you would be lost.</em><br><em>-Paradiso</em>, Canto II, lines 4-6</h4>\n\n<p>Joy is the business of Paradiso, that much is clear; but could there be a more mysterious word in the whole realm of human imagination than &#x201C;Joy?&#x201D; &#x201C;Joy&#x201D; boggles the human imagination because it asks us to follow the vector of hope to its maximal extension and intention, until it arrives at that point which Dante locates &#x201C;nel mezzo,&#x201D; at the very center of everything, at that point where every centripetal and centrifugal force of both the physical universe of energy and the symbolic universe of creative imagination and meaning first arise and finally return.</p>\n\n<p>From beginning to end, the Pilgrim&#x2019;s progress through Paradiso is enabled and guided by his enactment of the role to which he consented in the climactic episode of the Purgatorio in the garden of the Earthly Paradise. Now leaving Earth behind and beneath, the Pilgrim is transformed into the disciple; specifically, the disciple of Beatrice. She now becomes his true path, <em>la diritta via</em>, along which he gradually discovers the Joy that Christianity identifies as the hope of Resurrection.</p>\n\n<p>Dante&#x2019;s<em> Paradiso</em> maps the physics of freedom, tracing a universal history of meaning. Just as there is a physics of matter and energy, there is a physics of freedom governing the evolutionary history of hope which directs the human search for meaning in every person&#x2019;s life and in all human culture. In this universe, meaning functions as does light in the physical universe, acting as its absolute measure and enforcing its most basic law&#x2014;the law of relational identity, where &#x201C;all are responsible to all for all.&#x201D; Like the principle of relativity in the physics of energy, relational identity means that each personal existence has historical reality only in relation to all other personal identities.</p>\n\n<p>Almost everyone agrees that the poetry of the<em> Paradiso</em> is sublime. Sublimity, however, is a highly rarefied and strenuously acquired taste. This is why Dante himself warns us in the second canto of the<em> Paradiso </em>that unless we have become used to eat the &#x201C;bread of Angels,&#x201D; we should turn back and not attempt to follow him on this final leg of his journey, and we as modern-day readers might well be tempted here to turn back as the Pilgrim himself was tempted in the second canto of the <em>Inferno</em>.

{ title: 'Humanity and Nature in Chinese Thought',
  'short-desc': 'Think along with Classical Chinese masters as they explore and debate how and where we can find ethical guidance in nature.',
  description: '<p>If you are unable to access Youtube, the <a href="http://xuetangx.com/courses/HKUx/HKU03x/_/about" rel="noFollow" target="_blank">introductory video</a> is available via XuetangX.</p>\n\n<hr><p>We make ethical or behaviour guiding right / wrong judgments all the time but have you ever wondered where Ethics comes from, what it is about and why it is important? This course provides an introduction to traditional Chinese ethical thought and focuses on the pervasive contrast in the way Chinese and Westerners think about ethical guidance or guidance concerning what is right and what is wrong, good or bad.&#xA0; Traditional Western orthodoxy uses the metaphor of a law &#x2013; in its most familiar popular form, the command of a supernatural being backed by a threat of eternal punishment or reward &#x2013; to explain ethical guidance. The Classical Chinese philosophers by contrast were all naturalists. They talked about ethical guidance using a path metaphor &#x2013; a natural d&#xE0;o.</p>\n\n<p>We will look at two rival directions this natural d&#xE0;o model took in ancient China. The first direction views ethical paths as generated from human sources such as human history and past social practices. The other Confucian version views guidance as arising from a distinctly human guiding organ, something like a combination of our faculties of heart and mind. This organ issues the right/wrong or this/not-that judgements naturally. This internal map to moral choices branches, like a plant, as we mature. The alternative to human-based naturalism in China treated normative guidance as natural in a broader sense, such as the d&#xE0;o of water or one guided by what is beneficial vs harmful. Finally, we will take a brief look at a development after the classical period that resulted from the invasion of the more super-naturalist, Indo-European way of thinking about guidance &#x2013; Medieval Chinese Buddhism.</p>\n\n<p>Although Chinese concepts will be the focus of our discussion, all the content of this course is intended to be accessible to beginner students. For those who are beginners in Philosophy, we will include a brief introduction to the ideas of logic that further shape the Western metaphor of a law and help us understand its role in Western ethics, science and psychology so you can better understand the different ways these two philosophical metaphors explain where norms of behaviour come from, what they are about and why they are important.</p>',

Indeed, there is work aplenty on Mount Purgatorio, but there is also so much more. There is day and night, labor and rest, waking and dreaming, all the rhythms of diurnal living; but above all, there is the delight of hope. All that the penitent souls suffer here, they undergo in the eagerness of passionate yearning to be healed of the wounds of sin inflicted on them as part of the universal heritage of humanity. Purgatory is a &#x201C;school of contemplation,&#x201D; where the healing of wounds coincides with learning to suffer the weight of responsibility for one&#x2019;s own identity as a person. For those willing to undertake the steep ascent of Dante&#x2019;s seven-story Mountain, nowhere in the legacy of human culture is the process of becoming a &#x201C;whole person&#x201D; more closely observed or rendered with deeper psychological and social insight than in the cantos of Dante&#x2019;s <em>Purgatorio.</em></p>\n\n<p>For us as modern readers, Mount Purgatorio is a steep ascent indeed, and if fewer of us accept this challenging invitation than do for the careen through Hell, then it should come as no surprise for us to learn of the untold years, centuries perhaps, that the souls whom Dante meets there require to complete their climb. A realistic willingness to suffer consciously and voluntarily, motivated by authentic hope, is hardly recognized as a possibility by most of us today for whom security and prosperity are accepted as the unqualified goals of our striving. Even to consider an alternative of the sort which Dante offers us in the <em>Purgatorio </em>is already a notable achievement, but one which the imaginative power of Dante&#x2019;s poetry here places within our reach. Do not let the opportunity pass you by.</p>\n\n<p><span>In this course, you will be asked to participate in learning&#xA0;</span><span>activities on both edX and on MyDante, an innovative platform for deep&#xA0;</span><span>reading that emphasizes mindfulness and contemplative reading habits&#xA0;</span><span>as key to deriving lasting meaning from poetic texts.

While Dickinson wrote nearly 2,000 poems during her lifetime, she chose never to publish, opting instead to revisit and revise her works throughout her lifetime.&#xA0; Keeping this dynamic of self-revision in mind, we will consider a number of Dickinson&#x2019;s poems&#x2014;many seemingly in tension with one another&#x2014;concerned with Nature, Art, the Self, and Darkness. We will travel to the Dickinson Collection at Harvard&apos;s Houghton Library, and to Amherst, Massachusetts, paying a visit to the house in which the poet lived and wrote until her death in 1886. Distinguished guests for this module include NBA athlete Jason Collins, dancers Damian Woetzel and Charles &#x201C;Lil Buck&#x201D; Riley, and President and CEO of the New America Foundation Anne Marie Slaughter, among others.<br>\n&#xA0;<br>\nLed by Harvard Professor Elisa New, <em>Poetry in America</em> surveys nearly 400 years of American poetry. Through video lectures, archival images and texts, expeditions to historic sites, interpretive seminars with large and small groups, interviews with poets and scholars, and conversations about poems with distinguished Americans, Poetry in America embarks on a journey through the literature of a nation. Distinguished guests, including President Bill Clinton, Elena Kagan, Henry Louis Gates, Eve Ensler, John McCain, Andrea Mitchell, Michael Pollan, Drew Faust, Tony Kushner, and Nas, among others, bring fresh perspectives to the study of American Poetry.</p>\n\n<p>HarvardX pursues the science of learning.

{ title: 'Incarceration\'s Witnesses: American Prison Writing',
  'short-desc': 'In this course, we will study how first-person testimonial by incarcerated people writing about their experience inside—prisoner witness—can help us in understanding the American prison system. After a brief history of the U.S. prison system, early prisoner writing, and a survey of prisoner writing from 1904 to 1970, we will explore—through prisoner witness—the issues raised by the unprecedented rise of the nation’s mass-incarceration regime since the early 1970s.',
  description: '<p><span>The U.S. incarcerates a larger number and percentage of its own citizens than any nation on earth: larger than China, Russia, Cuba, or Iran. American ex-offenders are arrested again at a rate of 67% within three years, and 75% within five years of release. This course looks inside U.S. prisons, through the history of literary witness produced by incarcerated people. This history will help us to understand the mass-scale prison&#x2019;s rise, its day-to-day practices, and why it fails so badly at the task of rehabilitation. Through prison witness, we may hope to begin to understand what is needed to make the U.S. prison a more socially constructive institution. Among other texts, we will read and discuss Fourth City: Essays from the Prison in America, The (online) American Prison Writing Archive, hosted and made possible by Hamilton College&apos;s Digital Humanities Initiative, and come to a sense of the moral weight that prison witness must carry in any truly democratic debate on the criminal justice system.</span></p>',

Beginning with a discussion of the dramatic change in historians&#x2019; interpretations of the period in the last two generations,&#xA0;Foner&#xA0;goes on to discuss how Reconstruction turned on issues of continued relevance today. Among these are: who is an American citizen and what are citizens&#x2019; rights; what is the relationship between political and economic freedom; which has the primary responsibility for protecting Americans&#x2019; rights &#x2013; the federal or state governments; and how should public authorities respond to episodes of terrorism? The course explores the rewriting of the laws and Constitution to incorporate the principle of equality regardless of race; the accomplishments and failings of Reconstruction governments in the South; the reasons for violent opposition in the South and for the northern retreat from Reconstruction; and the consolidation at the end of the nineteenth century of a new system of white supremacy.&quot;</p>\n\n&#xA0;\n\n<p>Foner&#x2019;s new book <em><a href="http://books.wwnorton.com/books/Gateway-to-Freedom/" target="_blank">Gateway to Freedom: The Hidden History of the Underground Railroad</a>&#xA0;</em>is available wherever books are sold.</p>\n\n<p><strong>See other courses in this series:</strong><br><a href="https://www.edx.org/course/columbiax/columbiax-hist1-1x-civil-war-2241" target="_blank">The Civil War and Reconstruction - 1850-1861</a><br><a href="https://www.edx.org/course/columbiax/columbiax-hist1-2x-civil-war-2666" target="_blank">The Civil War and Reconstruction - 1861-1865</a></p>',

The fifth and final module in <em>The Ancient Greek Hero in 24 Hours</em>, &#x201C;Hours 22-24: Plato and Beyond&#x201D; challenges the idea that Socrates was a hero, just as Plato&#x2019;s&#xA0;Socrates himself challenges&#xA0;that same idea. And yet, as we will see from reading Plato&#x2019;s&#xA0;Apology of&#xA0;Socrates&#xA0;and&#xA0;Phaedo, the idea of the hero is very&#xA0;much present in Plato&#x2019;s works &#x2013; just as it persists in&#xA0;works beyond Plato,&#xA0;whether or not these works adopt Plato&#x2019;s project of trying to substitute&#xA0;philosophy for&#xA0;literature (especially for poetry). Just as poetry serves as a&#xA0;primary representative for the idea of the hero,&#xA0;we will discover though our&#xA0;close readings that the philosophical prose of Plato likewise represents this&#xA0;same idea - though now the hero is no longer some superhuman human. Rather, the&#xA0;real hero now&#xA0;becomes the word of philosophical dialogue, which is brought back&#xA0;to life much as a cult hero is brought&#xA0;back to life ever time a heroic life is&#xA0;narrated or dramatized. In Plato&#x2019;s works, the narration and the&#xA0;dramatization&#xA0;show not the life of the hero but the life of the word that survives the&#xA0;speaker of the word,&#xA0;provided that the word engages in dialogue &#x2013; a&#xA0;philosophical dialogue that contemplates the eternal truths&#xA0;of the cosmos.&#xA0;<br>\n&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;<br><strong>See other courses in this series:</strong><br><a href="https://www.edx.org/course/harvardx/harvardx-hum2-1x-ancient-greek-hero-24-3131">Module 1, &#x201C;Hours 1-5: Epic and Lyric&#x201D;</a><br><a href="https://www.edx.org/course/harvardx/harvardx-hum2-2x-ancient-greek-hero-24-3431">Module 2, &#x201C;Hours 6-11: Signs of the Hero in Epic and Iconography&#x201D;</a><br><a href="https://www.edx.org/course/harvardx/harvardx-hum2-3x-ancient-greek-hero-24-3916" target="_blank">Module 3, &#x201C;Hours 12-15: Cult of Heroes&#x201D;</a><br><a href="https://www.edx.org/course/harvardx/harvardx-hum2-4x-ancient-greek-hero-24-4011" target="_blank">Module 4, &#x201C;Hours 16-21: The Hero in Tragedy&#x201D;</a></p>\n\n<p>HarvardX pursues the science of learning.

The fourth of five modules in <em>The Ancient Greek Hero in 24 Hours</em>, &#x201C;Hours 16-21: The Hero in Tragedy&#x201D; finds us in the world of high classical poetry in drama,&#xA0;as brought to life&#xA0;in three tragedies of Aeschylus, two of Sophocles, and two of Euripides. We see&#xA0;here&#xA0;the Greek hero as best known to us from the perspective of world&#xA0;literature. The medium of drama makes&#xA0;heroes seem more familiar to us, since we&#xA0;think we know drama better than we know other verbal arts&#xA0;such as epic and&#xA0;lyric, but, by the time we finish analyzing the seven classical tragedies that&#xA0;we will be&#xA0;reading, we will see that the traditions of hero cult, infused into&#xA0;the verbal art of drama, cast an altogether&#xA0;new light on tragedy, defamiliarizing&#xA0;for us not only the heroes illuminated by this art but also the art itself.&#xA0;We&#xA0;will see, then, maybe for the first time ever, that the ancient Greek hero of&#xA0;tragedy was not at all like&#xA0;us &#x2013; even less like us than the hero of epic or&#xA0;lyric. The male and female heroes of drama were larger than&#xA0;life, far more so&#xA0;than we may ever have imagined, reaching levels of both nobility and debasement&#xA0;that&#xA0;challenge our sense of equilibrium in the cosmos. As our close readings of&#xA0;our seven chosen tragedies&#xA0;will show, there was a disequilibrium in myths about&#xA0;heroes in the remote past, and this disequilibrium&#xA0;could be compensated only by&#xA0;experiencing the equilibrium of rituals in the immediate present &#x2013; rituals&#xA0;culminating in the drama of heroic tragedy.<br>\n&#xA0;<br><strong>See other courses in this series:</strong><br><a href="https://www.edx.org/course/harvardx/harvardx-hum2-1x-ancient-greek-hero-24-3131">Module 1, &#x201C;Hours 1-5: Epic and Lyric&#x201D;</a><br><a href="https://www.edx.org/course/harvardx/harvardx-hum2-2x-ancient-greek-hero-24-3431">Module 2, &#x201C;Hours 6-11: Signs of the Hero in Epic and Iconography&#x201D;</a><br><a href="https://www.edx.org/course/harvardx/harvardx-hum2-3x-ancient-greek-hero-24-3916" target="_blank">Module 3, &#x201C;Hours 12-15: Cult of Heroes&#x201D;</a><br><a href="https://www.edx.org/course/harvardx/harvardx-hum2-5x-ancient-greek-hero-24-4026" target="_blank">Module 5, &#x201C;Hours 22-24: Plato and Beyond&#x201D;</a><br><br>\nHarvardX pursues the science of learning.

The third of five modules in <em>The Ancient Greek Hero in 24 Hours</em>, &#x201C;Hours 12-15: Cult of Heroes&#x201D; explores the vast variety of perspectives brought to bear on&#xA0;the idea of the&#xA0;ancient Greek hero in the versatile medium of prose, as exemplified by authors&#xA0;as varied&#xA0;as Herodotus, the so-called father of history, and Philostratus, an&#xA0;intellectual from a post-classical period&#xA0;who was prodigiously well-versed in classical&#xA0;and pre-classical lore about cult heroes.</p>\n\n<p>In&#xA0;Homeric poetry the idea of hero cult is implicit even though&#xA0;characters like Odysseus are not&#xA0;explicitly identified as cult heroes. The&#xA0;situation is different, however, in the poetry attributed to Hesiod,&#xA0;where the&#xA0;very idea of a cult hero is precisely outlined and illustrated, especially in&#xA0;the myth about the five&#xA0;generations of humankind. As we will see from&#xA0;the lively prose&#xA0;narratives of such learned and captivating authors as Herodotus and Philostratus, the mystique of cult heroes,&#xA0;both male&#xA0;and female, enthralled their adoring worshippers, who treasured the exotic&#xA0;stories of epiphanies and&#xA0;miracles that were linked with the places made sacred&#xA0;by the felt presence of heroes residing in the&#xA0;mother earth that concealed&#xA0;their bodies. We will even get the chance to read and analyze an&#xA0;eyewitness prose account of an actual initiation into the mysteries of a hero cult.&#xA0;This prose account&#xA0;brings home to us the seriousness of personally experiencing&#xA0;such an initiation, and it shows the&#xA0;emotional impact of making contact with&#xA0;the consciousness of superhuman forces that inhabit the&#xA0;mystical world of hero&#xA0;cult.</p>\n\n<p><strong>See other courses in this series:</strong><br>\n<a href="https://www.edx.org/course/harvardx/harvardx-hum2-1x-ancient-greek-hero-24-3131" target="_blank">Module 1, &#x201C;Hours 1-5: Epic and Lyric&#x201D;</a><br>\n<a href="https://www.edx.org/course/harvardx/harvardx-hum2-2x-ancient-greek-hero-24-3431" target="_blank">Module 2, &#x201C;Hours 6-11: Signs of the Hero in Epic and Iconography&#x201D;</a><br>\n<a href="https://www.edx.org/course/harvardx/harvardx-hum2-4x-ancient-greek-hero-24-4011" target="_blank">Module 4, &#x201C;Hours 16-21: The Hero in Tragedy&#x201D;</a><br>\n<a href="https://www.edx.org/course/harvardx/harvardx-hum2-5x-ancient-greek-hero-24-4026" target="_blank">Module 5, &#x201C;Hours 22-24: Plato and Beyond&#x201D;</a></p>\n<p>HarvardX pursues the science of learning.

  description: '<p>Students will question for themselves the meaning of human freedom, responsibility and identity by reading and responding to Dante Alighieri&apos;s <em>Divine Comedy</em>. <em>The Comedy</em>, which is richly steeped in the medieval culture of 14th century, still speaks vividly to modern readers struggling with the question, &#x201C;who am I?&#x201D; Dante, as a Florentine, a poet, a lover, and religious believer struggled with the same question in each facet of his life before coming to a moment of vision that wholly transformed him as a person.</p>\n\n<p>As a 21st century reader, you will encounter the poem in a novel online environment that integrates knowledge from the disciplines of literature, history, psychology, philosophy, and theology with modern technology. You will be guided through the poem by means of the &quot;MyDante&quot; Project, an online environment developed by Professor Ambrosio in collaboration with the Georgetown University Center for New Designs in Learning and Scholarship (CNDLS), which will aid your own contemplative engagement with the poem. Alone and with the edX community, you will reflect on both Dante&apos;s interpretation of freedom and how it functions in the formation of personal identity, and the problem of finding appropriate metaphors to discuss these issues in our modern life.</p>\n\n<p>You, the modern reader, will only understand the full implications of Dante&apos;s poetry if you participate with it in a way that is personal and is genuinely contemplative. You will discover that contemplative reading goes beyond the literal meaning, and even beyond the traditional allegorical and interpreted meaning, to apply every possible meaning contained in the text to your own life and identity. Through the MyDante platform, you will learn to know yourself in your own historical, personal, and spiritual contexts as&#xA0;<span>you journey toward a richer understanding of your freedom, identity and responsibility as a person.</span></p>\n\n<p><span>In this course, you will be asked to participate in learning activities on both edX and on MyDante, an innovative platform for deep reading that emphasizes mindfulness and contemplative reading habits as key to deriving lasting meaning from poetic texts.

Today, over 30 years since the first scientific reports of HIV/AIDS, the pandemic remains a major health concern throughout the world.

Shakespeare is also rightly regarded as one of the greatest playwrights the world has known. This course will try to understand both Shakespeare&#x2019;s popularity and his greatness by starting from a simple premise: that the fullest appreciation of Shakespeare can be achieved only when literary study is combined with analysis of the plays as theatre. Hence, as we delve into the dimensions that make Shakespeare&#x2019;s plays so extraordinary--from the astonishing power of their language to their uncanny capacity to illuminate so much of human life--we will also explore them in performance from Shakespeare&#x2019;s own theatre to the modern screen. At the same time, actors will occasionally join our effort and demonstrate ways of bringing the text alive as living theatre. Plays to be studied will include <em>Romeo and Juliet, A Midsummer Night&apos;s Dream, Much Ado About Nothing, Othello, King Lear</em>, and <em>The Winter&apos;s Tale</em>.</p>\n\n<p><em>Image courtesy Castle Rock Entertainment/The Kobal Collection</em></p>\n\n<p>Before your course starts, try the new edX Demo where you can explore the fun, interactive learning environment and virtual labs. <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/edx/edxdemo101/edx-demo/1038">Learn more</a>.</p>',

The focus will be on elements of the art such as poetry&#x2019;s historical relation to courtship; techniques of sound in free verse; poetry&#x2019;s relation to music; the nature of greatness&#x2014;with only incidental attention to schools of poetry, categories and trends.</p>\n\n<p>Students are encouraged to think truly, carefully and passionately about what the poem says, along with how the poem feels in one&#x2019;s own, actual or imagined voice. As Robert Pinsky says, in the Preface to <em>Singing School</em>: &#x201C;this anthology will succeed if it encourages the reader to emulate it by replacing it . . . create your own anthology.&#x201D; In a comparable way, this course hopes to inspire a lifelong study of poetry.</p>',

This course will examine architecture through time, beginning with First Societies and extending to the 15th century. Though the course is chronological, it is not intended as a linear narrative, but rather aims to provide a more global view, by focusing on different architectural &quot;moments.&quot; The lectures will give students the appropriate grounding for understanding a range of buildings and contexts. The material in the lectures will be supplemented by readings from the textbook <em>A Global History of Architecture</em>. Each lecture analyzes a particular architectural transformation arising from a dynamic cultural situation. How did the introduction of iron in the ninth century BCE impact regional politics and the development of architecture? How did new religious formations, such as Buddhism and Hinduism, produce new architectural understandings? What were the architectural consequences of the changing political landscape in northern Italy in the 14th century? How did rock-cut architecture move across space and time from West Asia to India to Africa? How did the emergence of corn impact the rise of religious and temple construction in Mexico? These are typical questions that the lectures will address.</p>\n\n<p>All required readings are available within the courseware, courtesy of Wiley. Print or electronic versions of the <em><a href="http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0470402571,descCd-buy.html">A Global History of Architecture, Second Edition</a></em> and <a href="http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-1118142101,descCd-buy.html"><em>Architecture of First Societies</em></a> are also available for purchase.</p>\n\n<p>The course is aimed for a general audience at the undergraduate level with an interest in history.

The second of five modules in <em>The Ancient Greek Hero in 24 Hours</em>, &#x201C;Hours 6-11: Signs of the Hero in Epic and Iconography&#x201D; explores the interactions of text and image in a culture where the &#x201C;text&#x201D; is not a written document but a live performance and where the &#x201C;image&#x201D; is not based on anything that is written down but exists as a free-standing medium of the visual arts, expressing the same myths that are being systematically expressed by the medium of Homeric poetry. Almost all of the images we will be studying are samples of a form of vase painting known as the &#x201C;Black Figure&#x201D; technique. We will practice how to &#x201C;read&#x201D; such a medium, analyzing what it tells us about ancient Greek heroes like Achilles, in conjunction with our &#x201C;reading&#x201D; the performance tradition of the Homeric Iliad itself.</p>\n\n<p>It is important to keep in mind, as we read these images and texts together, that the myths expressed by these media were meant to be taken very seriously. In the ancient Greek song culture, myth was not mere fiction. Just the opposite: myth was a formulation of eternal cosmic truths! So, the myths conveyed by the images of the paintings we will study are just as &#x201C;truthful,&#x201D; from the standpoint of ancient Greek song culture, as are the related myths conveyed by the Homeric Iliad. We need to read both the texts and the images of these myths as an accurate formulation of an integral system of thought the expresses most clearly and authoritatively all those things that really matter in life.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, this module foregrounds the historical fact, explored more fully in the third module (&#x201C;Hours 12-15: The Cult of Heroes&#x201D;), that the heroes who were characters in the myths of ancient Greek epic, lyric, and other verbal media were at the same time worshipped as superhuman forces by the communities where their bodies were thought to be hidden from outsiders. When we take for example the Homeric <em>Odyssey</em>, we find that the main hero of this epic, Odysseus, was a cult hero, not only an epic hero. And the agenda that center on the idea of a cult hero, like the prospect of immortalization after death, can be clearly seen in the overall plot of the <em>Odyssey</em>, especially in the memorable scene where the hero experiences his homecoming to Ithaca at the same moment when the sun rises as he wakes from a mystical overnight sleep while sailing homeward.</p>\n\n<p><strong>See other courses in this series:</strong><br>\n<a href="https://www.edx.org/course/harvardx/harvardx-hum2-1x-ancient-greek-hero-24-3131" target="_blank">Module 1, &#x201C;Hours 1-5: Epic and Lyric&#x201D;</a><br>\n<a href="https://www.edx.org/course/harvardx/harvardx-hum2-3x-ancient-greek-hero-24-3916" target="_blank">Module 3, &#x201C;Hours 12-15: Cult of Heroes&#x201D;</a><br>\n<a href="https://www.edx.org/course/harvardx/harvardx-hum2-4x-ancient-greek-hero-24-4011" target="_blank">Module 4, &#x201C;Hours 16-21: The Hero in Tragedy&#x201D;</a><br>\n<a href="https://www.edx.org/course/harvardx/harvardx-hum2-5x-ancient-greek-hero-24-4026" target="_blank">Module 5, &#x201C;Hours 22-24: Plato and Beyond&#x201D;</a></p>\n<p>HarvardX pursues the science of learning.

The course is based on the MIT &quot;Visualizing Cultures&quot; website devoted to image-driven research on Japan and China since the 19th century (<a href="http://visualizingcultures.mit.edu/">visualizingcultures.mit.edu</a>). The introductory module considers methodologies historians use to &#x201C;visualize&#x201D; the past, followed by three modules that explore the themes of Westernization, in Commodore Perry&#x2019;s 1853-54 expedition to Japan; social protest, in Tokyo&#x2019;s 1905 Hibiya Riot; and modernity, as seen in the archives of the major Japanese cosmetics company, Shiseido.</p>\n\n<p>Module 0: Introduction: New Historical Sources for a Digital Age (Professors Dower, Gordon, Miyagawa). Digitization has dramatically altered historians&apos; access to primary sources, making large databases of the visual record readily accessible. How is historical methodology changing in response to this seismic shift? How can scholars, students, and the general public make optimal use of these new digital resources?</p>\n\n<p>Module 1: Black Ships &amp; Samurai (Professor Dower). Commodore Matthew Perry&apos;s 1853-54 expedition to force Japan to open its doors to the outside world is an extraordinary moment to look at by examining and comparing the visual representations left to us by both the American and Japanese sides of this encounter. This module also addresses the rapid Westernization undertaken by Japan in the half century following the Perry mission.</p>\n\n<p>Module 2: Social Protest in Imperial Japan: The Hibiya Riot of 1905 (Professor Gordon). The dramatic daily reports from participants in the massive &quot;Hibiya Riot&quot; in 1905, the first major social protest in the age of &quot;imperial democracy&quot; in Japan, offer a vivid and fresh perspective on the contentious domestic politics of an emerging imperial power.</p>\n\n<p>Module 3: Modernity in Interwar Japan: Shiseido &amp; Consumer Culture (Professors Dower, Gordon, Weisenfeld). Exploring the vast archives of the Shiseido cosmetics company opens a fascinating window on the emergence of consumer culture, modern roles for women, and global cosmopolitanism from the &apos;teens through the 1920s and even into the era of Japanese militarism and aggression in the 1930s. This module will also tap other Visualizing Cultures units on modernization and modernity.</p>\n\n<p>NOTES:</p>\n\n<p><a href="https://www.edx.org/course/utokyox/utokyox-utokyo001x-visualizing-postwar-1545">UTokyo001x: Visualizing Postwar Tokyo</a>, by University of Tokyo, follows in this series.</p>\n\n<p>For MIT students: VJx will be part 21F.027J Visualizing Japan in the Modern World, a residential course taught by Professor Miyagawa, Fall 2014.</p>\n\n<p>In addition to MITx and HarvardX, this project is supported by the U.S. Japan Foundation, the University of Tokyo, and the Reischauer Institute of Japanese Studies, Harvard University.</p>\n\n<p>HarvardX pursues the science of learning.

Students are welcome to audit the course, and participate in all course activities. Certificates will not be issued.</em></p>\n\n<p>Everyone experiences adversity and stress at some level, whether it&#x2019;s the pressure to perform in school or work, relationship problems, financial difficulties, or simply the number of tasks to do in a short period of time. All stress isn&#x2019;t bad, but chronic stress can take its toll on our minds, bodies, and behavior. Research has shown that people can learn and use specific resilience skills (such as optimistic thinking, relaxation strategies, choosing one&#x2019;s attention) and positive routines (good sleep, scheduling in fun, and so on) in order to better manage stress, bounce back quicker after a setback, be more effective in their academic and vocational pursuits, develop stronger relationships with others, be physically and mentally healthy, and be satisfied with their lives overall. In short, resilience is ordinary magic and can be learned. It does not necessarily mean that you have to be born resilient or get lucky in life.</p>\n\n<p>The purpose of this course is to teach individuals the science behind becoming a resilient person. Stated simply, resilience is the ability to survive and thrive. Resiliency is not only about your ability to positively adapt in the face of adverse or challenging circumstances (that is, survive), but it is also about learning the positive skills, strategies and routines that enable you to live a happy, fulfilling, and meaningful life (in other words, thrive). This course gives you the permission to take care of yourself in order to effectively manage life stressors and do what matters most in life. This captures the notion of being from the inside out, which is a phrase that highlights the importance of promoting core resilience skills, strategies, and routines among early childhood educators. In turn, resilient people are more capable of creating and maintaining nurturing, supportive, and effective learning environments while also optimizing their own wellbeing and love for both the big and small things in life.</p>\n\n<p>By the end of this course, you will have learned about the knowledge and skills that you can apply in your life now and in the future to be a resilient person.</p>\n\n<p><u>Course goal:</u></p>\n\n<p>The goal for this course is to give you permission to take care of yourself and empower you to be a resilient person. A resilient person is someone who:</p>\n\n<ul><li>purposely strives to be as mentally and psychically healthy as possible,</li>\n\t<li>possesses the confidence to effectively cope with and manage stressful situations,</li>\n\t<li>is compassionate towards self and others,</li>\n\t<li>demonstrates grit or perseverance even in the face of adversity, and</li>\n\t<li>focuses on the positive and fulfilling aspects of life.</li>\n</ul><p><u>Course supporting objectives: </u>When you complete this course, you will be able to:</p>\n\n<ul><li>Describe why &#x2018;functioning from the inside out&#x2019; is critical to becoming a resilient, effective person\n\t<ul><li>Explain the benefits of resilience and how the specific skills translate into optimizing social-emotional wellbeing and doing what matters most in life</li>\n\t</ul></li>\n\t<li>Directly practice a variety of resilience skills in different aspects of your life, including but not limited to:\n\t<ul><li>Mindfulness practices</li>\n\t\t<li>Strategies to manage intense emotions</li>\n\t\t<li>Activities that induce positive emotions</li>\n\t\t<li>Clarifying important personal values (that is, what matters most) and committing to behaving consistent with them</li>\n\t\t<li>Making health lifestyle choices that are cheap and readily available, yet promote well-being</li>\n\t</ul></li>\n\t<li>Describe why &#x2018;practicing&#x2019; and integrating resilience skills into one&#x2019;s life is critical to making them a habit and becoming a resilient person</li>\n\t<li>Develop a resilience plan that serves as a roadmap for your future</li>\n</ul>',

The first of five modules on The Ancient Greek Hero, &#x201C;Epic and Lyric&#x201D; looks at ancient Greek heroes from the perspective of two different but related media of poetry and songmaking, <em>epic</em> and <em>lyric</em>. The major focus is Achilles, especially as viewed through the lens of the Homeric <em>Iliad</em> <u>and</u> through the &#x201C;rose-colored glasses&#x201D; of Sappho&#x2019;s songs. While the epic of the <em>Iliad</em> is typical of verbal art that is performed by and for men, the lyric songs of Sappho derive from traditions of singing performed mainly by women of all ages, including adolescents about to be initiated into womanhood. These &#x201C;women&#x2019;s traditions&#x201D; are best known for two kinds of singing, laments and love songs, which are interchangeable in contexts that will surprise the modern mind. Another surprise, as we will see, is that the <em>Iliad</em> too contains embedded &#x201C;quotations&#x201D; of such laments and love songs, and that our first impression of this epic as a &#x201C;men&#x2019;s tradition&#x201D; obscures the fact that Homeric poetry channels the songs of women as well as men. A perfect expression of such &#x201C;channeling&#x201D; is the figure of Achilles himself, who was admired by Greek song culture as a virtuoso singer of laments and love songs in his own right. An analysis of Homeric passages that &#x201C;quote&#x201D; the singing of Achilles will be an integral part of our overall experience in close reading.</p>\n\n<p><strong>See other courses in this series:</strong><br><a href="https://www.edx.org/course/harvardx/harvardx-hum2-2x-ancient-greek-hero-24-3431" target="_blank">Module 2, &#x201C;Hours 6-11: Signs of the Hero in Epic and Iconography&#x201D;</a><br><a href="https://www.edx.org/course/harvardx/harvardx-hum2-3x-ancient-greek-hero-24-3916" target="_blank">Module 3, &#x201C;Hours 12-15: Cult of Heroes&#x201D;</a><br><a href="https://www.edx.org/course/harvardx/harvardx-hum2-4x-ancient-greek-hero-24-4011" target="_blank">Module 4, &#x201C;Hours 16-21: The Hero in Tragedy&#x201D;</a><br><a href="https://www.edx.org/course/harvardx/harvardx-hum2-5x-ancient-greek-hero-24-4026" target="_blank">Module 5, &#x201C;Hours 22-24: Plato and Beyond&#x201D;</a></p>\n\n<p>HarvardX pursues the science of learning.

Philosophers, scientists, artists, and poets overthrew our understanding of the physical world, of human behavior, of thought and its limits, and of art, creativity, and beauty. Scientific progress improved the way we lived across the world. Yet the last century also brought increased levels of war, tyranny, and genocide. Man pushed boundaries of good and evil, right and wrong, justice and injustice &#x2013; and people lost faith in values. Now, thinkers and leaders are reconstructing theories of value and creating institutions to embody them.

Over four centuries, Harvard University has amassed an astonishing array of tangible things&#x2014;books and manuscripts, art works, scientific specimens, ethnographic artifacts, and historical relics of all sorts. The university not only owns a Gutenberg bible, it also cares for Turkish sun dials, a Chinese crystal ball, a divination basket from Angola, and nineteenth-century &#x201C;spirit writing&#x201D; chalked on a child-sized slate. Tucked away in storage cabinets or hidden in closets and the backrooms of its museums and libraries are Henry David Thoreau&#x2019;s pencil, a life mask of Abraham Lincoln, and chemicals captured from a Confederate ship.

Students will learn how to identify high-performing nonprofit organizations and fulfill their personal goals for giving. Six compact classes are comprised of lectures, interactive exercises, group discussions, and interviews with prominent philanthropists Warren Buffett, Doris Buffet, Cal Ripken, Jr., Soledad O&#x2019;Brien, Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield (Ben and Jerry), Tom Werner, and Patrick Dempsey. Students will also be invited to nominate nonprofit organizations in their communities to receive real-dollar grants. A minimum of $100,000 will be distributed to the organizations ranked highest by students using a peer-review selection process based on course concepts.</p>\n\n<p>To receive a certificate of completion, students must complete 1-2 brief exercises per class, participate in discussion sessions, and complete weekly assessments of their peers&#x2019; grant nominations. All students are welcome, but not required, to submit grant nominations.</p>\n\n<p><span>EdX is proud to support to the The Learning by Giving Foundation and to offer the Giving With Purpose course on <a href="http://www.edx.org" target="_blank">edx.org</a>.

That past can be directly observed through the study of the human fossil record, the materials preserved for archaeological study, and the DNA of living and extinct human populations. This course will provide an overview of human evolutionary history from the present--contemporary human variation in a comparative context--through our last common ancestor with the living great apes, some 5-7 million years in the past. Emphasis will be placed on major evolutionary changes in the development of humans and the methodological approaches used by paleoanthropologists and related investigators to develop that knowledge. The course will begin by asking basic questions about how evolution operates to shape biological variation and what patterns of variation look like in living humans and apes. We will then look at how the human lineage first began to differentiate from apes, the rise and fall of the Australopithecines, the origin and dispersal of the genus Homo, and eventually the radical evolutionary changes associated with the development of agricultural practices in the past 15,000 years. Throughout the course students will be exposed to the primary data, places and theories that shape our understanding of human evolution.</p>\n\n<p><em>Image: Hands at the Cuevas de las Manos upon R&#xED;o Pinturas, near the town of Perito Moreno in Santa Cruz Province, Argentina.

  description: '<h4>*Note - This is an Archived course*</h4>\n\n<p>This is a past/archived course. At this time, you can only explore this course in a self-paced fashion.

Make sure to check for reruns of this course.</p>\n\n<hr><p>What is it to be human, and how can ancient concepts of the heroic and anti-heroic inform our understanding of the human condition? That question is at the core of <em>The Ancient Greek Hero</em>, which introduces (or reintroduces) students to the great texts of classical Greek culture by focusing on concepts of the Hero in an engaging, highly comparative way.</p>\n\n<p>The classical Greeks&apos; concepts of Heroes and the &quot;heroic&quot; were very different from the way we understand the term today. In this course, students analyze Greek heroes and anti-heroes in their own historical contexts, in order to gain an understanding of these concepts as they were originally understood while also learning how they can inform our understanding of the human condition in general.</p>\n\n<p>In Greek tradition, a hero was a human, male or female, of the remote past, who was endowed with superhuman abilities by virtue of being descended from an immortal god. Rather than being paragons of virtue, as heroes are viewed in many modern cultures, ancient Greek heroes had all of the qualities and faults of their fellow humans, but on a much larger scale. Further, despite their mortality, heroes, like the gods, were objects of cult worship &#x2013; a dimension which is also explored in depth in the course.</p>\n\n<p>The original sources studied in this course include the Homeric <em>Iliad</em> and <em>Odyssey</em>; tragedies of Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides; songs of Sappho and Pindar; dialogues of Plato; historical texts of Herodotus; and more, including the intriguing but rarely studied dialogue &quot;On Heroes&quot; by Philostratus. All works are presented in English translation, with attention to the subtleties of the original Greek. These original sources are frequently supplemented both by ancient art and by modern comparanda, including opera and cinema (from Jacques Offenbach&apos;s opera <em>Tales of Hoffman</em> to Ridley Scott&apos;s science fiction classic <em>Blade Runner</em>).</p>\n\n<p>The true hero of the course is the logos (&quot;word&quot;) of reasoned expression, as activated by Socratic dialogue. The logos of dialogue requires both careful thought and close (or &quot;slow&quot;) reading, which is a core skill taught in this class. The course begins by considering the heroes of Homer&apos;s epics and ends with Plato&apos;s memories of the final days of Socrates -- memories which can only be fully understood by a reader who has gained a thorough comprehension of the ancient Greek hero in all his or her various manifestations.</p>\n\n<p>Using modern technology and engaging texts, <em>The Ancient Greek Hero </em>provides students who have no previous background in classical Greek civilization with a fully engaging and immediately accessible introduction to the most beautiful moments in this ancient literature, its myths, and its ritual practices.</p>\n\n<p>Before your course starts, try the new edX Demo where you can explore the fun, interactive learning environment and virtual labs. <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/edx/edxdemo101/edx-demo/1038">Learn more</a>.</p>\n\n<p>HarvardX pursues the science of learning.

{ title: 'Greeks at War: Homer at Troy',
  'short-desc': 'Gain a broad-based understanding of warfare in ancient Greece through Homer’s account of the Trojan War in the Iliad. ',
  description: '<p>Homer&#x2019;s account of the Trojan War in the <u>Iliad</u> explores the effects of warfare&#xA0;upon Greeks and Trojans alike. It illustrates not only the challenges that the&#xA0;combatants faced, but also the plight of innocent victims&#x2013; women, children, and the elderly. Though the <u>Iliad </u>is often regarded as a kind of Greek national epic, Homer is remarkably even-handed in his treatment of the two sides, even seeming to favor the Trojans over the Greeks at times. He repeatedly emphasizes the horrors of war and his varied descriptions&#xA0;of deaths on the battlefield are unparalleled in both intensity and, paradoxically,&#xA0;poetic charm. The primary objective of warfare in the imaginary time period depicted by Homer is to attain personal glory through acts of individual prowess, with the good of the community seen as a secondary goal.<br>\n&#xA0;<br>\nThis course explores the idea that war is both universal and particular. The Vietnam War was not the same as the Iraq War. In every war, some things are the same, while some are different. Intense suffering and horrific acts are inevitable. However, the mode of fighting, the resources, the arms, the equipment, the treatment of prisoners, the command structure, and the ideology driving men and women to fight all differ.<br>\n&#xA0;<br>\nIn this course, we will balance the universal with the particular. You will learn:</p>\n\n<ul><li>The causes and contentions of the Trojan War through the eyes of Homer</li>\n\t<li>What made the Trojan War unique and historically significant</li>\n\t<li><span>What links the experience of this war to the men and women serving their country today, as well as innocent civilians caught up in the crossfire.</span></li>\n</ul>',

By combining theory and practice, the course not only aims to provide a clear view of the historical development of the music, but also emphasizes the training of aural skills and the accumulation of musical knowledge. The course covers not only classical music, such as neo-classical, expressionism, nationalism and other genres, but also explores in depth jazz, rock, and pop music of the 20th century. While studying Chinese music and other forms of national folk music in the 20th century world music context, students will also analyze large and complex works such as opera, musicals, and film music. By enhancing students&#x2019; understanding of 20th century Western music (classical music, pop music, folk music, comprehensive art) as a foundation, three core questions will be addressed: what is music, what is the 20th century Western music, and what is effective listening? The course aims to guide students to examine the three listening modes of 20th century Western music with the hope of forming a diverse and multi-faceted, knowledge and understanding of the 20th-century Western music culture phenomena, expanding students&#x2019; horizons, enhancing their ability to reason by analogy, and promoting cross-disciplinary, creative development.</p>\n\n<p>&#x8BFE;&#x7A0B;&#x6240;&#x6D89;&#x4E0D;&#x4EC5;&#x6DB5;&#x76D6;&#x53E4;&#x5178;&#x97F3;&#x4E50;&#x5982;&#x65B0;&#x53E4;&#x5178;&#x4E3B;&#x4E49;&#x3001;&#x8868;&#x73B0;&#x4E3B;&#x4E49;&#x3001;&#x6C11;&#x65CF;&#x4E3B;&#x4E49;&#x7B49;&#x6D41;&#x6D3E;&#xFF0C;&#x4E5F;&#x5BF9;&#x7235;&#x58EB;&#x4E50;&#x3001;&#x6447;&#x6EDA;&#x4E50;&#x4E0E;&#x6D41;&#x884C;&#x97F3;&#x4E50;&#x5728;20&#x4E16;&#x7EAA;&#x7684;&#x98CE;&#x683C;&#x60C5;&#x72B6;&#x6295;&#x4EE5;&#x6DF1;&#x5207;&#x5173;&#x6CE8;&#xFF1B;&#x5728;&#x5C06;&#x5305;&#x62EC;&#x4E2D;&#x56FD;&#x97F3;&#x4E50;&#x5728;&#x5185;&#x7684;&#x4E16;&#x754C;&#x5404;&#x56FD;&#x6C11;&#x65CF;&#x6C11;&#x95F4;&#x97F3;&#x4E50;&#x7EB3;&#x5165;20&#x4E16;&#x7EAA;&#x5927;&#x80CC;&#x666F;&#x4E88;&#x4EE5;&#x7814;&#x7A76;&#x63A2;&#x7D22;&#x4E4B;&#x540C;&#x65F6;&#xFF0C;&#x5173;&#x4E8E;&#x5927;&#x578B;&#x7EFC;&#x5408;&#x827A;&#x672F;&#x54C1;&#x4F8B;&#x5982;&#x6B4C;&#x5267;&#x3001;&#x97F3;&#x4E50;&#x5267;&#x3001;&#x7535;&#x5F71;&#x97F3;&#x4E50;&#x7684;&#x8003;&#x5BDF;&#x4E0E;&#x5206;&#x6790;&#xFF0C;&#x4E5F;&#x8BBE;&#x4E3A;&#x4E13;&#x9898;&#xFF0C;&#x7EDD;&#x65E0;&#x504F;&#x5E9F;&#x3002;</p>\n\n<p>&#x8BFE;&#x7A0B;&#x4EE5;20&#x4E16;&#x7EAA;&#x897F;&#x65B9;&#x97F3;&#x4E50;&#x4E3A;&#x4E3B;&#x4F53;&#x5185;&#x5BB9;&#xFF0C;&#x5728;&#x6E05;&#x6670;&#x8D2F;&#x7A7F;&#x5386;&#x53F2;&#x7EBF;&#x7D22;&#x548C;&#x4FA7;&#x91CD;&#x53F2;&#x89C2;&#x53D1;&#x5C55;&#x4E4B;&#x540C;&#x65F6;&#xFF0C;&#x5C24;&#x4E3A;&#x5F3A;&#x8C03;&#x97F3;&#x4E50;&#x8046;&#x542C;&#x80FD;&#x529B;&#x7684;&#x57F9;&#x517B;&#xFF0C;&#x589E;&#x8FDB;&#x97F3;&#x4E50;&#x77E5;&#x8BC6;&#x7684;&#x79EF;&#x7D2F;&#xFF0C;&#x51F8;&#x663E;&#x7406;&#x8BBA;&#x4E0E;&#x5B9E;&#x8DF5;&#x76F8;&#x7ED3;&#x5408;&#x7684;&#x5F00;&#x8BFE;&#x7406;&#x5FF5;&#x3002;&#x4EC0;&#x4E48;&#x662F;&#x97F3;&#x4E50;&#x3001;&#x4EC0;&#x4E48;&#x662F;20&#x4E16;&#x7EAA;&#x897F;&#x65B9;&#x97F3;&#x4E50;&#x3001;&#x4EC0;&#x4E48;&#x662F;&#x6709;&#x6548;&#x8046;&#x542C;&#x6210;&#x4E3A;&#x5168;&#x8BFE;&#x6838;&#x5FC3;&#x77E5;&#x8BC6;&#x652F;&#x67F1;&#xFF0C;&#x5F15;&#x5BFC;&#x5B66;&#x751F;&#x63A2;&#x67E5;&#x5173;&#x4E8E;20&#x4E16;&#x7EAA;&#x897F;&#x65B9;&#x97F3;&#x4E50;&#x7684;&#x4E09;&#x79CD;&#x8046;&#x542C;&#x6A21;&#x5F0F;&#xFF0C;&#x4EE5;&#x671F;&#x5BF9;&#x5173;&#x4E8E;20&#x4E16;&#x7EAA;&#x897F;&#x65B9;&#x97F3;&#x4E50;&#x6587;&#x5316;&#x8BF8;&#x591A;&#x73B0;&#x8C61;&#x5F62;&#x6210;&#x591A;&#x89C6;&#x89D2;&#x3001;&#x591A;&#x7EF4;&#x5EA6;&#x3001;&#x591A;&#x65B9;&#x6CD5;&#x3001;&#x591A;&#x63A5;&#x53E3;&#x7684;&#x8BA4;&#x8BC6;&#x4E0E;&#x7406;&#x89E3;&#xFF0C;&#x4ECE;&#x800C;&#x4E3A;&#x5B66;&#x751F;&#x5F00;&#x62D3;&#x773C;&#x754C;&#x3001;&#x89E6;&#x7C7B;&#x65C1;&#x901A;&#x3001;&#x591A;&#x5B66;&#x79D1;&#x4EA4;&#x53C9;&#x3001;&#x521B;&#x9020;&#x529B;&#x4E4B;&#x53D1;&#x5C55;&#xFF0C;&#x5B8C;&#x7F8E;&#x4EBA;&#x683C;&#x4E4B;&#x5F62;&#x6210;&#xFF0C;&#x63D0;&#x4F9B;&#x5B9E;&#x9645;&#x800C;&#x624E;&#x5B9E;&#x7684;&#x670D;&#x52A1;&#x3002;</p>\n\n<p>The course is one of the PKU-DeTao MOOCs, which is a joint effort by Peking University and DeTao Masters Academy. &#x8BE5;&#x8BFE;&#x7A0B;&#x662F;&#x201C;&#x5317;&#x5927;-&#x5FB7;&#x7A3B;&#x7F51;&#x7EDC;&#x5F00;&#x653E;&#x8BFE;&#x7A0B;&#x201D;&#x4E2D;&#x7684;&#x4E00;&#x95E8;&#xFF0C;&#x7531;&#x5317;&#x4EAC;&#x5927;&#x5B66;&#x4E0E;&#x5FB7;&#x7A3B;&#x6559;&#x80B2;&#x8054;&#x5408;&#x63D0;&#x4F9B;&#x3002;</p>',

Even if you want to have a good relationship with them, this lack of understanding can make interactions tense, unpredictable and scary! The same is true for a lot of people as they encounter statistics and mathematical ways of working with data. &#xA0;Statistics can be confusing and opaque. &#xA0;Symbols, Greek letters, very large and very small numbers, and how to interpret all of this can leave to feeling cold and disengaged&#x2014;even fearful and resentful.<br>\n&#xA0;<br>\nBut in the modern information age, having a healthy relationship with statistics can make life a whole lot easier. We are constantly faced with an onslaught of data and claims about it&#x2014;from news articles, to Facebook and blog posts, casual and professional conversations, reports at our workplace, advertising, and claims from politicians and public officials. How can we process that information, make sense of it, evaluate truth claims, and put ourselves in a position to act on the information? &#xA0;One of the most important ways is by befriending statistics and consistently using statistical ways of thinking.<br>\n&#xA0;<br>\nThe purpose of this course, then is to help you develop a functional, satisfying, and useful life-long relationship with statistics. To achieve that goal, we will take a non-technical approach&#x2014;you will learn how statistics work and why they are so helpful in evaluating the world of information that is around us. You will learn about the logic of statistical thinking and the concepts (rather than the mathematical details and probability theory) that guide statistical inferences and conclusions.<br>\n&#xA0;<br>\nYou do not need to be a math whiz to take this course. If you can add, subtract, multiply, and divide (or just be able to use a calculator to do that!), you will be more than able to handle what will happen as this relationship develops.<br><br>\nBut by the end of the course you will be able to:</p>\n\n<ul><li>Identify the most important features of a data set</li>\n\t<li>Select a statistical test based on the features of the data</li>\n\t<li>Think like a statistical detective</li>\n\t<li>Understand the relationship between two different characteristics or variables</li>\n\t<li>Perform some simple statistical calculations and draw some conclusions from real data</li>\n\t<li>Hopefully, love stats!&#xA0;</li>\n</ul><p>We&#x2019;ll do all of this using entertaining examples related to real-life situations we all encounter in everyday life.</p>',

In session 1, we learnt Linear Lists, Stacks, Queues, Strings, Binary Trees, Trees and Graphs, which are fundamental data structures. In the second session, we will study advanced data structures and algorithms, such as Sorting, Searching, Indexing, as well as their applications thoroughly. More detailed, these chapters include a variety of classic Sorting algorithms (Quicksort, External Sorting), Searching methods (Sets, Hash Tables, Bitmaps), Indexing structures (B/B+ trees, Trie trees), Advanced List-Structure (generalized lists, Multi-dimensional arrays) and Balanced Binary Trees (AVL, Red-Black trees, Splay trees). The second part of the course lasts eight weeks. Each week, student will spend 4-8 hours to follow this course.</p>\n\n<p align="left">Students who score 60% or higher will receive an Honor Code Certificate.</p>\n\n<p align="left">The Autumn 2014 Sessions of this course are supported by Google.</p>',

Principled investigations to monitor and thus improve the health of individuals are firmly based on a sound understanding of modern quantitative methods. This involves the ability to discover patterns and extract knowledge from health data on a sample of individuals and then to infer, with measured uncertainty, the unobserved population characteristics. This course will address this need by covering the principles of biostatistics and epidemiology used for public health and clinical research. These include outcomes measurement, measures of associations between outcomes and their determinants, study design options, bias and confounding, probability and diagnostic tests, confidence intervals and hypothesis testing, power and sample size determinations, life tables and survival methods, regression methods (both, linear and logistic), and sample survey techniques. Students will analyze sample data sets to acquire knowledge of appropriate computer software. By the end of the course the successful student should have attained a sound understanding of these methods and a solid foundation for further study.</p>\n\n<p>HarvardX pursues the science of learning.

This course aims to make this cutting-edge material broadly accessible to undergraduate students, including computer science majors who do not have any prior exposure to quantum mechanics. The course starts with a simple introduction to the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics using the concepts of qubits (or quantum bits) and quantum gates. This treatment emphasizes the paradoxical nature of the subject, including entanglement, non-local correlations, the no-cloning theorem and quantum teleportation. The course covers the fundamentals of quantum algorithms, including the quantum fourier transform, period finding, Shor&apos;s quantum algorithm for factoring integers, as well as the prospects for quantum algorithms for NP-complete problems. It also discusses the basic ideas behind the experimental realization of quantum computers, including the prospects for adiabatic quantum optimization and the D-Wave controversy.</p>\n\n<p>Before your course starts, try the new edX Demo where you can explore the fun, interactive learning environment and virtual labs. <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/edx/edxdemo101/edx-demo/1038">Learn more</a>.</p>',

Situations, for instance, in which innovative new energy technologies emerge into the existing energy system. Or new health technology, medicine, treatments or screening technologies are being developed and society has to decide about whether they should be allowed and what they may cost.</p>\n\n<p>What to do about expanding international airports that have the habit of developing closely to densely populated areas? These airports are believed to contribute substantially to the economy and industrial activity in a country but also generate substantial hindrance when it comes to noise and local air quality. What to do about the multi-facetted and multi-subsystem linkages of the ICT based emergency response system in a country, where at different places decisions have to be made that may influence the safety of people substantially.</p>\n\n<p>In situations such as the above, it is by far not obvious what the best solution is. All people involved have a different idea about what the solution should be. And if you ask them, all these people have different ideas about what the problem exactly is either. If you, as engineer, consultant, manager, policy maker, politician or analyst are in a situation like this, then<em> what to do</em>?</p>\n\n<p>There are multiple ways, but one option that has proven to be very useful is the analytical, engineering like approach of analysing the problem, a methodology for making the problem explicit and rationalising the different potential solutions. In short: analytically based support of decision making, design and implementation of solutions.</p>\n\n<p>Problem analysis as a course teaches such a method. It contains tools like:</p>\n\n<ul><li>Actor analysis</li>\n\t<li>Causal modelling</li>\n\t<li>Goal trees and means-end diagrams</li>\n\t<li>Problem diagrams</li>\n\t<li>Uncertainty</li>\n\t<li>Decision Support</li>\n\t<li>Score cards</li>\n</ul><p>This course introduces each technique and each technique will immediately be applied to a concrete case.

Stat2.3x is the last in a sequence of three courses that make up Stat2x, the online equivalent of Berkeley&apos;s Stat 2. The focus of Stat2.3x is on statistical inference: how to make valid conclusions based on data from random samples. At the heart of the main problem addressed by the course will be a population (which you can imagine for now as a set of people) connected with which there is a numerical quantity of interest (which you can imagine for now as the average number of MOOCs the people have taken). If you could talk to each member of the population, you could calculate that number exactly. But what if the population is so large that your resources will not stretch to interviewing every member? What if you can only reach a subset of the population?</p>\n\n<p>Stat 2.3x will discuss good ways to select the subset (yes, at random); how to estimate the numerical quantity of interest, based on what you see in your sample; and ways to test hypotheses about numerical or probabilistic aspects of the problem.</p>\n\n<p>The methods that will be covered are among the most commonly used of all statistical techniques. If you have ever read an article that claimed, &quot;The margin of error in such surveys is about three percentage points,&quot; or, &quot;Researchers at the University of California at Berkeley have discovered a highly significant link between ...,&quot; then you should expect that by the end of Stat 2.3x you will have a pretty good idea of what that means. Examples will range all the way from a little girl&apos;s school science project (seriously &#x2013; she did a great job and her results were published in a major journal) to rulings by the U.S. Supreme Court.</p>\n\n<p>The fundamental approach of the series was provided in the description of Stat2.1x and appears here again: There will be no mindless memorization of formulas and methods.

New techniques make it possible and affordable to generate massive data sets in biology. Researchers and clinicians can measure the activity for each of 30000 genes of a patient. They can read the complete genome sequence of a patient. Thanks to another trend of the decade, open access publishing, the results of such large scale health science are very often published for you to read free of charge. You can even access the raw data from open databases such as the gene expression database of the NCBI, National Center for Biotechnology Information.</p>\n\n<p>In this course you will learn the basics of R, a powerful open source statistical programming language. Why has R become the tool of choice in bioinformatics, the health sciences and many other fields? One reason is surely that it&#x2019;s powerful and that you can download it for free right now. But more importantly, it&#x2019;s supported by an active user community.&#xA0;In this course you will learn how to use peer reviewed packages for solving problems at the frontline of health science research.

We can enjoy these fanciful visions of leaps of genius, but we should not be fooled into believing that they&#x2019;re reality. Brilliant innovators are brilliant because they practice habits of thinking that inevitably carry them step by step to works of genius. No magic and no leaps are involved.<br><br>\nProfessor Starbird will discuss how habits of effective thinking and creativity can be taught and learned through mathematics. Anyone who practices them will inevitably create new insights, new ideas, and new solutions.

Students will learn how to identify high-performing nonprofit organizations and fulfill their personal goals for giving. Six compact classes are comprised of lectures, interactive exercises, group discussions, and interviews with prominent philanthropists Warren Buffett, Doris Buffet, Cal Ripken, Jr., Soledad O&#x2019;Brien, Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield (Ben and Jerry), Tom Werner, and Patrick Dempsey. Students will also be invited to nominate nonprofit organizations in their communities to receive real-dollar grants. A minimum of $100,000 will be distributed to the organizations ranked highest by students using a peer-review selection process based on course concepts.</p>\n\n<p>To receive a certificate of completion, students must complete 1-2 brief exercises per class, participate in discussion sessions, and complete weekly assessments of their peers&#x2019; grant nominations. All students are welcome, but not required, to submit grant nominations.</p>\n\n<p><span>EdX is proud to support to the The Learning by Giving Foundation and to offer the Giving With Purpose course on <a href="http://www.edx.org" target="_blank">edx.org</a>.

It is now being offered globally as one of Peking University&#x2019;s MOOCs.&#xA0;</p>\n\n<p>Addressing students&apos; interests in 20th century Western Music Culture and incorporating music theory, the course examines 20th century Western music. By combining theory and practice, the course not only aims to provide a clear view of the historical development of the music, but also emphasizes the training of aural skills and the accumulation of musical knowledge. The course covers not only classical music, such as neo-classical, expressionism, nationalism and other genres, but also explores in depth jazz, rock, and pop music of the 20th century. While studying Chinese music and other forms of national folk music in the 20th century world music context, students will also analyze large and complex works such as opera, musicals, and film music. By enhancing students&#x2019; understanding of 20th century Western music (classical music, pop music, folk music, comprehensive art) as a foundation, three core questions will be addressed: what is music, what is the 20th century Western music, and what is effective listening? The course aims to guide students to examine the three listening modes of 20th century Western music with the hope of forming a diverse and multi-faceted, knowledge and understanding of the 20th-century Western music culture phenomena, expanding students&#x2019; horizons, enhancing their ability to reason by analogy, and promoting cross-disciplinary, creative development.</p>\n\n<p>&#x8BFE;&#x7A0B;&#x6240;&#x6D89;&#x4E0D;&#x4EC5;&#x6DB5;&#x76D6;&#x53E4;&#x5178;&#x97F3;&#x4E50;&#x5982;&#x65B0;&#x53E4;&#x5178;&#x4E3B;&#x4E49;&#x3001;&#x8868;&#x73B0;&#x4E3B;&#x4E49;&#x3001;&#x6C11;&#x65CF;&#x4E3B;&#x4E49;&#x7B49;&#x6D41;&#x6D3E;&#xFF0C;&#x4E5F;&#x5BF9;&#x7235;&#x58EB;&#x4E50;&#x3001;&#x6447;&#x6EDA;&#x4E50;&#x4E0E;&#x6D41;&#x884C;&#x97F3;&#x4E50;&#x5728;20&#x4E16;&#x7EAA;&#x7684;&#x98CE;&#x683C;&#x60C5;&#x72B6;&#x6295;&#x4EE5;&#x6DF1;&#x5207;&#x5173;&#x6CE8;&#xFF1B;&#x5728;&#x5C06;&#x5305;&#x62EC;&#x4E2D;&#x56FD;&#x97F3;&#x4E50;&#x5728;&#x5185;&#x7684;&#x4E16;&#x754C;&#x5404;&#x56FD;&#x6C11;&#x65CF;&#x6C11;&#x95F4;&#x97F3;&#x4E50;&#x7EB3;&#x5165;20&#x4E16;&#x7EAA;&#x5927;&#x80CC;&#x666F;&#x4E88;&#x4EE5;&#x7814;&#x7A76;&#x63A2;&#x7D22;&#x4E4B;&#x540C;&#x65F6;&#xFF0C;&#x5173;&#x4E8E;&#x5927;&#x578B;&#x7EFC;&#x5408;&#x827A;&#x672F;&#x54C1;&#x4F8B;&#x5982;&#x6B4C;&#x5267;&#x3001;&#x97F3;&#x4E50;&#x5267;&#x3001;&#x7535;&#x5F71;&#x97F3;&#x4E50;&#x7684;&#x8003;&#x5BDF;&#x4E0E;&#x5206;&#x6790;&#xFF0C;&#x4E5F;&#x8BBE;&#x4E3A;&#x4E13;&#x9898;&#xFF0C;&#x7EDD;&#x65E0;&#x504F;&#x5E9F;&#x3002;</p>\n\n<p>&#x8BFE;&#x7A0B;&#x4EE5;20&#x4E16;&#x7EAA;&#x897F;&#x65B9;&#x97F3;&#x4E50;&#x4E3A;&#x4E3B;&#x4F53;&#x5185;&#x5BB9;&#xFF0C;&#x5728;&#x6E05;&#x6670;&#x8D2F;&#x7A7F;&#x5386;&#x53F2;&#x7EBF;&#x7D22;&#x548C;&#x4FA7;&#x91CD;&#x53F2;&#x89C2;&#x53D1;&#x5C55;&#x4E4B;&#x540C;&#x65F6;&#xFF0C;&#x5C24;&#x4E3A;&#x5F3A;&#x8C03;&#x97F3;&#x4E50;&#x8046;&#x542C;&#x80FD;&#x529B;&#x7684;&#x57F9;&#x517B;&#xFF0C;&#x589E;&#x8FDB;&#x97F3;&#x4E50;&#x77E5;&#x8BC6;&#x7684;&#x79EF;&#x7D2F;&#xFF0C;&#x51F8;&#x663E;&#x7406;&#x8BBA;&#x4E0E;&#x5B9E;&#x8DF5;&#x76F8;&#x7ED3;&#x5408;&#x7684;&#x5F00;&#x8BFE;&#x7406;&#x5FF5;&#x3002;&#x4EC0;&#x4E48;&#x662F;&#x97F3;&#x4E50;&#x3001;&#x4EC0;&#x4E48;&#x662F;20&#x4E16;&#x7EAA;&#x897F;&#x65B9;&#x97F3;&#x4E50;&#x3001;&#x4EC0;&#x4E48;&#x662F;&#x6709;&#x6548;&#x8046;&#x542C;&#x6210;&#x4E3A;&#x5168;&#x8BFE;&#x6838;&#x5FC3;&#x77E5;&#x8BC6;&#x652F;&#x67F1;&#xFF0C;&#x5F15;&#x5BFC;&#x5B66;&#x751F;&#x63A2;&#x67E5;&#x5173;&#x4E8E;20&#x4E16;&#x7EAA;&#x897F;&#x65B9;&#x97F3;&#x4E50;&#x7684;&#x4E09;&#x79CD;&#x8046;&#x542C;&#x6A21;&#x5F0F;&#xFF0C;&#x4EE5;&#x671F;&#x5BF9;&#x5173;&#x4E8E;20&#x4E16;&#x7EAA;&#x897F;&#x65B9;&#x97F3;&#x4E50;&#x6587;&#x5316;&#x8BF8;&#x591A;&#x73B0;&#x8C61;&#x5F62;&#x6210;&#x591A;&#x89C6;&#x89D2;&#x3001;&#x591A;&#x7EF4;&#x5EA6;&#x3001;&#x591A;&#x65B9;&#x6CD5;&#x3001;&#x591A;&#x63A5;&#x53E3;&#x7684;&#x8BA4;&#x8BC6;&#x4E0E;&#x7406;&#x89E3;&#xFF0C;&#x4ECE;&#x800C;&#x4E3A;&#x5B66;&#x751F;&#x5F00;&#x62D3;&#x773C;&#x754C;&#x3001;&#x89E6;&#x7C7B;&#x65C1;&#x901A;&#x3001;&#x591A;&#x5B66;&#x79D1;&#x4EA4;&#x53C9;&#x3001;&#x521B;&#x9020;&#x529B;&#x4E4B;&#x53D1;&#x5C55;&#xFF0C;&#x5B8C;&#x7F8E;&#x4EBA;&#x683C;&#x4E4B;&#x5F62;&#x6210;&#xFF0C;&#x63D0;&#x4F9B;&#x5B9E;&#x9645;&#x800C;&#x624E;&#x5B9E;&#x7684;&#x670D;&#x52A1;&#x3002;</p>\n\n<p>The course is one of the PKU-DeTao MOOCs, which is a joint effort by Peking University and DeTao Masters Academy. &#x8BE5;&#x8BFE;&#x7A0B;&#x662F;&#x201C;&#x5317;&#x5927;-&#x5FB7;&#x7A3B;&#x7F51;&#x7EDC;&#x5F00;&#x653E;&#x8BFE;&#x7A0B;&#x201D;&#x4E2D;&#x7684;&#x4E00;&#x95E8;&#xFF0C;&#x7531;&#x5317;&#x4EAC;&#x5927;&#x5B66;&#x4E0E;&#x5FB7;&#x7A3B;&#x6559;&#x80B2;&#x8054;&#x5408;&#x63D0;&#x4F9B;&#x3002;</p>',

  'short-desc': 'Explore the identity of Jesus Christ through a treatment of Israel, the Gospels, and the traditions of the Church.',
  description: '<p>The Bible says that Jesus was identified &#xA0;as God&apos;s beloved son at his baptism. The same identification was made about Israel in the Old Testament and the disciples of Christ at their baptism. The striking similarity of these titles establishes a tight interrelationship between the people Israel, the person of Jesus Christ, and the church.<br>\n&#xA0;<br>\nIn this course, we will explore how a close reading of the book of Genesis, the Gospels, and early Christian writers can shed further light on these relationships and, in so doing, deepen our understanding of the figure of Jesus Christ. &#xA0;Unlike many other treatments, this course does not presume that Jesus&#x2019; character can be plumbed solely by an examination of the Gospel stories. The witness of the Jewish scriptures and the lives of the saints are also important sources for this task.<br>\n&#xA0;<br>\nThe course will be eight weeks in length and organized around three topical questions:<br>\nWho is Israel? (primary source material: the book of Genesis)<br>\nWho is Jesus? (primary source material: the Gospels and the Creeds)<br>\nWho is the Church? (primary source material: a selection of post-Biblical Christian writers)<br>\n&#xA0;<br>\nNo matter what your background in the study of theology, this course will provide a fresh approach to the identify of Jesus Christ that will reveal how the church has explored the unmeasurable depths of his person.</p>',

  'short-desc': 'Leaving Earth behind and beneath, the Pilgrim Dante is transformed into the disciple of Beatrice. She now becomes his true path, la diritta via, along which he gradually discovers the Joy that Christianity identifies as the hope of Resurrection.',
  description: '<h4><em>Turn back if you would see your shores again.</em><br><em>Do not set forth upon the deep,</em><br><em>for, losing sight of me, you would be lost.</em><br><em>-Paradiso</em>, Canto II, lines 4-6</h4>\n\n<p>Joy is the business of Paradiso, that much is clear; but could there be a more mysterious word in the whole realm of human imagination than &#x201C;Joy?&#x201D; &#x201C;Joy&#x201D; boggles the human imagination because it asks us to follow the vector of hope to its maximal extension and intention, until it arrives at that point which Dante locates &#x201C;nel mezzo,&#x201D; at the very center of everything, at that point where every centripetal and centrifugal force of both the physical universe of energy and the symbolic universe of creative imagination and meaning first arise and finally return.</p>\n\n<p>From beginning to end, the Pilgrim&#x2019;s progress through Paradiso is enabled and guided by his enactment of the role to which he consented in the climactic episode of the Purgatorio in the garden of the Earthly Paradise. Now leaving Earth behind and beneath, the Pilgrim is transformed into the disciple; specifically, the disciple of Beatrice. She now becomes his true path, <em>la diritta via</em>, along which he gradually discovers the Joy that Christianity identifies as the hope of Resurrection.</p>\n\n<p>Dante&#x2019;s<em> Paradiso</em> maps the physics of freedom, tracing a universal history of meaning. Just as there is a physics of matter and energy, there is a physics of freedom governing the evolutionary history of hope which directs the human search for meaning in every person&#x2019;s life and in all human culture. In this universe, meaning functions as does light in the physical universe, acting as its absolute measure and enforcing its most basic law&#x2014;the law of relational identity, where &#x201C;all are responsible to all for all.&#x201D; Like the principle of relativity in the physics of energy, relational identity means that each personal existence has historical reality only in relation to all other personal identities.</p>\n\n<p>Almost everyone agrees that the poetry of the<em> Paradiso</em> is sublime. Sublimity, however, is a highly rarefied and strenuously acquired taste. This is why Dante himself warns us in the second canto of the<em> Paradiso </em>that unless we have become used to eat the &#x201C;bread of Angels,&#x201D; we should turn back and not attempt to follow him on this final leg of his journey, and we as modern-day readers might well be tempted here to turn back as the Pilgrim himself was tempted in the second canto of the <em>Inferno</em>. But to paraphrase Virgil&#x2019;s response then, which both encouraged and challenged, &#x201C;Why be so afraid to reach for what your heart most hopes for; where else do you have to turn?&#x201D;</p>\n\n<p><span>In this course, you will be asked to participate in learning&#xA0;</span><span>activities on both edX and on MyDante, an innovative platform for deep&#xA0;</span><span>reading that emphasizes mindfulness and contemplative reading habits</span><br><span>as key to deriving lasting meaning from poetic texts.

{ title: 'Humanity and Nature in Chinese Thought',
  'short-desc': 'Think along with Classical Chinese masters as they explore and debate how and where we can find ethical guidance in nature.',
  description: '<p>If you are unable to access Youtube, the <a href="http://xuetangx.com/courses/HKUx/HKU03x/_/about" rel="noFollow" target="_blank">introductory video</a> is available via XuetangX.</p>\n\n<hr><p>We make ethical or behaviour guiding right / wrong judgments all the time but have you ever wondered where Ethics comes from, what it is about and why it is important? This course provides an introduction to traditional Chinese ethical thought and focuses on the pervasive contrast in the way Chinese and Westerners think about ethical guidance or guidance concerning what is right and what is wrong, good or bad.&#xA0; Traditional Western orthodoxy uses the metaphor of a law &#x2013; in its most familiar popular form, the command of a supernatural being backed by a threat of eternal punishment or reward &#x2013; to explain ethical guidance. The Classical Chinese philosophers by contrast were all naturalists. They talked about ethical guidance using a path metaphor &#x2013; a natural d&#xE0;o.</p>\n\n<p>We will look at two rival directions this natural d&#xE0;o model took in ancient China. The first direction views ethical paths as generated from human sources such as human history and past social practices. The other Confucian version views guidance as arising from a distinctly human guiding organ, something like a combination of our faculties of heart and mind. This organ issues the right/wrong or this/not-that judgements naturally. This internal map to moral choices branches, like a plant, as we mature. The alternative to human-based naturalism in China treated normative guidance as natural in a broader sense, such as the d&#xE0;o of water or one guided by what is beneficial vs harmful. Finally, we will take a brief look at a development after the classical period that resulted from the invasion of the more super-naturalist, Indo-European way of thinking about guidance &#x2013; Medieval Chinese Buddhism.</p>\n\n<p>Although Chinese concepts will be the focus of our discussion, all the content of this course is intended to be accessible to beginner students. For those who are beginners in Philosophy, we will include a brief introduction to the ideas of logic that further shape the Western metaphor of a law and help us understand its role in Western ethics, science and psychology so you can better understand the different ways these two philosophical metaphors explain where norms of behaviour come from, what they are about and why they are important.</p>',

  'short-desc': 'After his harrowing descent into the depths of despair, the Pilgrim Dante emerges with Virgil onto the Isle of Mount Purgatorio in the southern hemisphere. There he will be healed of sin and prepared for his climactic reunion with Beatrice.',
  description: '<p><em>Now I shall sing the second kingdom,</em><br><em>there where the soul of man is cleansed,</em><br><em>made worthy to ascend to Heaven.</em><br><em>-Purgatorio</em>, Canto I, lines 4-6</p>\n\n<p>While Hell is &#x201C;black, confined, stinking, noisy, and suffocating, the great Mountain of Purgatory rises in pure sunlit solitude out of the windswept southern sea.&#x201D; (Sayers,<em> Purgatorio;</em> Introduction)&#xA0; Dante has undergone a conversion which has, literally, turned his world upside down.</p>\n\n<p>Sadly, the majority of Dante&#x2019;s readers do not accompany him beyond his escape from the Inferno, in part, perhaps, because of an instinctive anticipation that when the excitement of adventure is over, then the hard work of maturation must begin. Indeed, there is work aplenty on Mount Purgatorio, but there is also so much more. There is day and night, labor and rest, waking and dreaming, all the rhythms of diurnal living; but above all, there is the delight of hope. All that the penitent souls suffer here, they undergo in the eagerness of passionate yearning to be healed of the wounds of sin inflicted on them as part of the universal heritage of humanity. Purgatory is a &#x201C;school of contemplation,&#x201D; where the healing of wounds coincides with learning to suffer the weight of responsibility for one&#x2019;s own identity as a person. For those willing to undertake the steep ascent of Dante&#x2019;s seven-story Mountain, nowhere in the legacy of human culture is the process of becoming a &#x201C;whole person&#x201D; more closely observed or rendered with deeper psychological and social insight than in the cantos of Dante&#x2019;s <em>Purgatorio.</em></p>\n\n<p>For us as modern readers, Mount Purgatorio is a steep ascent indeed, and if fewer of us accept this challenging invitation than do for the careen through Hell, then it should come as no surprise for us to learn of the untold years, centuries perhaps, that the souls whom Dante meets there require to complete their climb. A realistic willingness to suffer consciously and voluntarily, motivated by authentic hope, is hardly recognized as a possibility by most of us today for whom security and prosperity are accepted as the unqualified goals of our striving. Even to consider an alternative of the sort which Dante offers us in the <em>Purgatorio </em>is already a notable achievement, but one which the imaginative power of Dante&#x2019;s poetry here places within our reach. Do not let the opportunity pass you by.</p>\n\n<p><span>In this course, you will be asked to participate in learning&#xA0;</span><span>activities on both edX and on MyDante, an innovative platform for deep&#xA0;</span><span>reading that emphasizes mindfulness and contemplative reading habits&#xA0;</span><span>as key to deriving lasting meaning from poetic texts.

It is an exercise in the deliberation of issues, persuasion, and the polling of results. JuryX: Deliberations for Social Change is an invitation to explore the concept of jury in both in theory and in practice, exploring both the political theory and history of the jury as well as techniques for engaging in juristic discussion.</p>\n<p>The course consists of six modules. In each module, you will begin by engaging with a case on your own, much like a jury views evidence, before engaging in small group discussions with your peers about the topic at hand. The course begins with historical legal cases and then moves to major contemporary issues. These include: decriminalization of marijuana in Jamaica and worldwide efforts to legalize, the potential for the Olympics and World Cup to advance education, individual identity and anonymity surrounding the NSA leak by Edward Snowden, and lethal police action against young black men, crystallized in the hashtag #icantbreathe.</p>\n<p>Deliberations will be real and virtual, synchronous and asynchronous. &#x2028;Cases will be hosted on the edX platform, but deliberation groups will meet in a variety of media best suited to each group. The supported deliberation environment for online synchronous deliberation will be &#x2018;Unhangout,&#x2019; a video-based discussion tool developed at the MIT Media Lab. Many other opportunities for gathering, deliberating, and returning results are also available, including face-to-face gathering and asynchronous deliberation online using open social media like Facebook and Loomio.</p>\n<p>JuryX: Deliberations for Social Change is ultimately about the most fundamental of human interactions: communication.

Cases that will be discussed are, among others, nanotechnology, offshore wind parks, Google car, nuclear power, cloud computing, smart meters for electricity, robots in the care sector (carebots), low budget meteorological weather stations&#xA0; in Africa and CO2 &#xA0;capture and storage.<br>\nDuring the course you may team-up with your fellow students to discuss the case studies in an international context. Moreover, students are encouraged to bring their own cases in dedicated discussion fora.</p>\n\n<p><u>Learning goals</u></p>\n\n<ul><li>To understand and to be able to explain the various theories on -and dimensions of- &#xA0;responsible innovation.</li>\n\t<li>To be able to recognize instances of responsible and irresponsible innovation.</li>\n\t<li>To be able to discuss and assess (the ethical and societal implications of) real-life cases at the hand of theories pertaining to responsible innovation.</li>\n\t<li>To be able to apply tools and approaches to responsible innovation, like Value Sensitive Design, to own innovation efforts.</li>\n</ul><p>This MOOC is for all those interested in the relationship between technological innovations, ethics and society.

Since then, the technique has evolved tremendously, giving hope and increased quality of life to many patients around the world. While the technology and drugs advance, several controversies persist regarding the way in which organs may be obtained. Some of these dilemmas arose on the very first day in which organs&#x2019; transplantation originated; others have emerged as a result of new phenomena such as transplantation tourism, the new possibilities brought by donation after cardio-circulatory death, or increasing knowledge about the remaining physiological functions detected in patients pronounced as brain dead. Almost all countries in the world forbid the selling of organs. Why? Although many people die while on the waiting lists, in no country does the Government confiscate cadaveric organs. Why? May minors be organ donors? Should we abandon the so-called &#x201C;dead donor rule&#x201D; and allow &#x201C;organ-donation euthanasia&#x201D;? How does the potential condition of becoming a donor influence the administration of end-of-life care? How should we avoid the eventual conflict of interests between those who care for the life of future recipients of organs and those who are in charge of the dying patient-eventual-donor? In this course we will explore the answers to these questions, and we will also engage in the assessment of the more recent challenges posed by novel transplantation techniques, and, albeit briefly, in the discussion regarding the fair distribution of organs.&#xA0;</em></p>',

Today, over 30 years since the first scientific reports of HIV/AIDS, the pandemic remains a major health concern throughout the world. But, rays of hope have led to speculation that an AIDS-free generation may be possible.

  description: '<p>Students will question for themselves the meaning of human freedom, responsibility and identity by reading and responding to Dante Alighieri&apos;s <em>Divine Comedy</em>. <em>The Comedy</em>, which is richly steeped in the medieval culture of 14th century, still speaks vividly to modern readers struggling with the question, &#x201C;who am I?&#x201D; Dante, as a Florentine, a poet, a lover, and religious believer struggled with the same question in each facet of his life before coming to a moment of vision that wholly transformed him as a person.</p>\n\n<p>As a 21st century reader, you will encounter the poem in a novel online environment that integrates knowledge from the disciplines of literature, history, psychology, philosophy, and theology with modern technology. You will be guided through the poem by means of the &quot;MyDante&quot; Project, an online environment developed by Professor Ambrosio in collaboration with the Georgetown University Center for New Designs in Learning and Scholarship (CNDLS), which will aid your own contemplative engagement with the poem. Alone and with the edX community, you will reflect on both Dante&apos;s interpretation of freedom and how it functions in the formation of personal identity, and the problem of finding appropriate metaphors to discuss these issues in our modern life.</p>\n\n<p>You, the modern reader, will only understand the full implications of Dante&apos;s poetry if you participate with it in a way that is personal and is genuinely contemplative. You will discover that contemplative reading goes beyond the literal meaning, and even beyond the traditional allegorical and interpreted meaning, to apply every possible meaning contained in the text to your own life and identity. Through the MyDante platform, you will learn to know yourself in your own historical, personal, and spiritual contexts as&#xA0;<span>you journey toward a richer understanding of your freedom, identity and responsibility as a person.</span></p>\n\n<p><span>In this course, you will be asked to participate in learning activities on both edX and on MyDante, an innovative platform for deep reading that emphasizes mindfulness and contemplative reading habits as key to deriving lasting meaning from poetic texts.

If so, then this course is for you. Last spring, we kicked off a world-wide experiment to see if Kegan and Lahey&#x2019;s ground-breaking, award-winning approach (the <em>Immunity to Change</em> process) could be deployed online to help tens of thousands of people make lasting changes at work or in their private lives. The experiment was largely a success! Many participants succeeded at making important changes in their lives. Here&#x2019;s what our students have to say:</p>\n\n<ul><li>&#x201C;When I first started, I was a bit skeptical on how I would actually change. Looking back at myself 14 weeks ago and comparing it with how I am now is incredible! I couldn&apos;t be happier that I decided to take this course and learn a new approach to change. My life is so much better because of it.&#x201D;</li>\n\t<li>&#x201C;Someone asked me recently if I felt like I&apos;d just wasted 14 whole weeks on self-inquiry. I can honestly say no - I feel like I wasted 30 years sleepwalking!&#xA0; An incredible experience. Bob and Lisa have created a truly wondrous process, and the staff and fellow students have built a rich and supportive learning environment.&#x201D;&#xA0;</li>\n\t<li>&#x201C;I appreciated the opportunity to feel like I was a part of a bigger community striving to grow and improve. This made me want to constantly push myself because I believed in the power behind the material and in the power of being part of a community working toward similar goals.&#x201D;</li>\n\t<li>&#x201C;This has been an amazing course and I have made long lasting changes that I didn&apos;t even dream about when I began this course. There is no way to express my deepest thank you for that . . . my life is changed.&#x201D;</li>\n</ul><p>This fall, we invite you to join us in a continuation of this experimental personal development course. Via demonstrations, exercises, readings, personal experiments, and novel interactive tools, this course will teach you new psychological theory about personal change, but&#x2014;more than this&#x2014;it will engage you in applying that theory to yourself from the first class to the last.</p>\n\n<p>In 2011 Oprah Winfrey listed the Top Ten Things You Should Do to Start the New Year Right.

In Leaders of Learning we will explore learning, leadership, organizational structure, and physical design.</p>\n\n<p>The only requirements for Leaders of Learning are:</p>\n\n<ul><li>an interest in the evolving world of learning;</li>\n\t<li>a curiosity about leadership in this new world;</li>\n\t<li>a willingness to examine your own beliefs about learning; and</li>\n\t<li>an openness to sharing your thoughts with and responding to others</li>\n</ul><p>HarvardX pursues the science of learning. By registering as an online learner in an HX course, you will also participate in research about learning. <a href="http://harvardx.harvard.edu/research-statement" target="_self">Read our research statement to learn more.</a></p>',

{ title: 'The Science of Everyday Thinking',

  description: '<h4>*Note - This is an Archived course*</h4>\n\n<p>This is a past/archived course. At this time, you can only explore this course in a self-paced fashion. Certain features of this course may not be active, but many people enjoy watching the videos and working with the materials. Make sure to check for reruns of this course.&#xA0;</p>\n\n<hr><p>We will explore everyday thinking: why people believe weird things, how we form and change our opinions, why our expectations skew our judgments, and how we can make better decisions. We discuss and debate topics such as medical diagnosis, paranormal phenomena, placebos, miracles, and more. You will learn how to evaluate claims, make sense of evidence, and understand why we so often make irrational choices. You will begin to rely on slow, effortful, deliberative, analytic, and logical thinking rather than fast, automatic, instinctive, emotional, and stereotypical thinking. The course provides tools for how to think independently, how to be skeptical, and how to value data over personal experience. We will examine the mental shortcuts and rules-of-thumb that people use and misuse, and apply this knowledge to everyday situations to help make better decisions.</p>\n\n<p>The Think101 team has travelled far and wide to film conversations with some very clever people including: Daniel Kahneman, who won the Nobel in economic science; Elizabeth Loftus who pioneered the study of false memories; and even the MythBusters about testing claims and distinguishing between fact and fiction. We met 21 leading thinkers from across the world and combined hundreds of hours of conversations, demonstrations, and assessment into short episodes on how to evaluate claims, learn and remember information better, and improve everyday thinking.</p>',
